The earlier you start, the richer you become. Invest most or all of your money in index funds. Keep your costs of investing and taxes low. Don’t try to time the market. Tune out the noise, rebalance your portfolio when necessary and stick with your plan. By doing those things, you will intelligently manage risk. You will buy low, sell high and have the power of compounding working in your favor.

You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at www. publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm, or in a low-cost mutual fund like Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities or Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Fund.13 Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal substitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run, so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors, allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelligent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe—and entirely beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.

It is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may involve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible missing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to put in stocks, except when the general market level is much higher than can be justified by well-established standards of value.

Humans will believe anything you say provided you do not exhibit the smallest shadow of diffidence; like animals, they can detect the smallest crack in your confidence before you express it. The trick is to be as smooth as possible in personal manners. It is much easier to signal self-confidence if you are exceedingly polite and friendly; you can control people without having to offend their sensitivity. The problem with business people, Nero realized, is that if you act like a loser they will treat you as a loser—you set the yardstick yourself. There is no absolute measure of good or bad. It is not what you are telling people, it is how you are saying it.

We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good stuff, but not for the bad. This causes us to think that we are better than others at whatever we do for a living.

For earnings yield, the formula looks for companies that earn a lot compared to the price we have to pay. For return on capital, the formula looks for companies that earn a lot compared to how much the company has to pay to buy the assets that created those earnings. To calculate these ratios, the magic formula doesn’t look at future earnings. That’s too hard. The magic formula uses last year’s earnings.

For those stocks with a gain, we will want to sell a day or two after the one-year period is up. In that way, all of our gains will receive the advantages of the lower tax rate afforded to long-term capital gains (a maximum 15 percent tax rate under federal guidelines for stocks held more than one year), and all of our losses will receive short-term tax treat-ment (a deduction against other sources of income that otherwise could have been taxable at rates up to 35 percent). Over time, this minor adjustment can add significantly to our after-tax investment returns.

ROE measures the efficiency with which a company uses shareholders’ equity—think of it as measuring profits per dollar of shareholders’ capital. One flaw of ROE is that companies can take on a lot of debt and boost their ROE without becoming more profitable, so it’s a good idea to look at ROE alongside how much debt a company has.

Finally, there’s return on invested capital (ROIC), which combines the best of both worlds. It measures the return on all capital invested in the firm, regardless of whether it is equity or debt. So, it incorporates debt—unlike ROA—but removes the distortion that can make highly leveraged companies look very profitable using ROE. It also uses a different definition of profits that helps remove any effects caused by a company’s financing decisions (debt versus equity), so we can get as close as possible to a number that represents the true efficiency of the underlying business.

Always remember the four drivers of valuation: risk, return on capital, competitive advantage, and growth. All else being equal, you should pay less for riskier stocks, more for companies with high returns on capital, more for companies with strong competitive advantages, and more for companies with higher growth prospects. Bear in mind that these drivers compound each other.

I recommend using a small-market fund in place of a small-growth fund, and a large-market (i.e., S&P 500) fund in place of a large-growth fund. You will get enough exposure to large- and small-growth stocks via the S&P 500, total market, and small cap index funds, since they consist mainly of growth issues.

you get the most “bang for the buck” by about a five-year maturity. This is the steepest part of the yield curve— the part that rewards you the most. Beyond that, the extra return diminishes, with continually increasing risk. The stock portion of your portfolio is the place to take risk, not the bond portion, where the purpose is to shelter you from market downturns and provide ready liq- uidity. The curve is steepest in the first year or two. For the most part, then, you should keep the maturity of your bond portfolio between one and five years. There are a wide variety of bond funds that will accomplish this.

We are told that poverty is a natural phenomenon that can be fixed with aid. But in reality it is a political problem: poverty doesn’t just exist, it has been created. Poor countries are poor because they are integrated into the global economic system on unequal terms. Aid only works to hide the deep patterns of wealth extraction that cause poverty and inequality in the first place: rigged trade deals, tax evasion, land grabs and the costs associated with climate change.

The fact that slavery was used up through the 19th century further contributed to downward pressure on wages, as workers had to compete with free labour. And why do poor countries have a comparative deficit of capital in the first place? Partly because they were plundered of precious metals, and partly because their colonisers forcibly destroyed local industries so that they would have no choice but to consume Western exports.

The solution to mass poverty turns out to be remarkably simple. Poor people don’t need charity, they need fair wages for their work, labour unions to defend those wages and state regulation that prevents exploitation. They need decent public services – such as universal healthcare and education – and a progressive taxation system capable of funding them. They need fair access to land and a fair share of natural resource wealth. In other words, real development requires the redistribution of power, which then in most cases naturally precipitates a redistribution of resources.

Forcing governments to repay their debts at exorbitant interest rates – and forcing them to take out new loans in order to cover the old ones – meant that many countries ended up spending large proportions of their national budgets on debt service. Cutting spending on social services meant that hospitals and clinics fell apart, and investment in education fell to the point where it became impossible to produce the skills necessary for development. Cutting subsidies meant that farmers no longer had access to affordable inputs like seeds and equipment, that families spent increasing proportions of their income on food, and that infant industries no longer received the support they needed to become competitive on the global stage. Privatisation meant that key public services were run at a profit, which raised prices out of reach of the poor. Reducing trade tariffs meant that customs revenues collapsed, while foreign goods and competitors flooded in and undercut local producers, driving them out of business. Liberalising the financial sector meant that investors could pull their money out at the drop of a hat, which left finance dangerously unstable and unpredictable.

Insulin is the hormone that moves glucose or sugar from the bloodstream into the cells. At optimal levels, insulin is your friend, functioning as an anabolic hormone to stimulate tissue growth. Unfortunately, in excess, it becomes your enemy. Excessive insulin can lead to a "spare tire" of unsightly and unhealthy body fat around the waistline. Too much insulin raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and hinders the work of your hormones of youth. Extra insulin also stimulates production of cortisol, which stimulates production of more insulin, thereby creating a vicious cycle. Excessive insulin, which is a consequence of high-sugar and high-glycemic-food diets so common today, does more to accelerate the aging process than just about any other contributor.

All cancers, however, are characterized by the uncontrolled replication of cells. Normal cells reproduce only as needed, such as to build new tissues in a growing child and to replace cells that have gotten sickly or have died. Cancerous cells, on the other hand, are linked to DNA (genetic) mutations that cause them to divide continuously, creating a continually growing number of new cancerous cells. Unstopped, these cells can damage or starve the affected organ or system. Cancerous cells also sometimes spread (metastasize) from the original site in the body to cause cancerous cells to form in other distant organs or systems. It is this process that accounts for the majority of the deaths from cancer. Your risk of contracting cancer is determined to some extent by your genes, as evidenced by certain cancers, such as breast cancer, that seem to run in families. However, the principal cause of the DNA mutations that trigger such uncontrolled cell growth is exposure to free radicals. These are unstable molecules that steal electrons from other molecules in your body, including your DNA molecules. This can seriously damage the attacked molecule, sometimes causing mutations that lead to cancer.

Your body requires a constant supply of these amino acid building blocks to live. And while your body can produce its own supply of many amino acids, eight are known as essential amino acids because you must obtain them from your food. Consuming complete protein from sources such as meat, milk, and other animal products provides you with all eight essential amino acids. But you don't need to consume complete proteins as long as you eat all eight essential amino acids over the course of each day, not necessarily at every meal.

Nuts, legumes (peas, lentils, beans, etc.), and whole grains are all healthy sources of vegetable protein. Soybeans are a particularly good protein source, being the only complete vegetable protein containing all eight essential amino acids. Soy also contains valuable vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and fiber. In addition to traditional foods, such as tofu, soy protein can now be found in a wide range of products, including soy milk, soy burgers, and soy pastas. A number of health benefits have also been attributed to consumption of soy products, such as a slight lowering of cholesterol levels. Soy may also be beneficial in helping prevent cardiovascular disease, some hormonally sensitive cancers, and menopausal osteoporosis. Yet, moderation must also be applied to soy. Excessive consumption of soy products has been found to decrease absorption of iron, zinc, and possibly other minerals; can adversely affect thyroid function; and may decrease fertility in men.

Processing whole-wheat flour into white flour or brown rice into white rice removes the fiber and bran. This turns healthy carbohydrates into unhealthy ones that promote inflammation. Fiber and bran fill you up before you get too many calories. Also, they slow the rate of absorption from your gut into your blood, so your blood sugar rises slowly and not too high. When fiber and bran are removed, your food gets rapidly absorbed, causing your blood sugar to spike to high levels, which in turn causes your pancreas to secrete insulin to bring your blood sugar back down. After a while, it’s as if these repeated surges of insulin cause your insulin receptors to say, “Oh, no, not more insulin!” so they downregulate and become less sensitive. Because of this, your body needs to make more and more insulin to lower your blood sugar an equivalent amount. This is called insulin resistance.

It’s not just the calories that you eat; more important are the calories you absorb from your gut into your blood—and this is influenced by your microbiome. A high-fat diet causes the growth of microbes that harvest energy more efficiently—in other words, you gain more weight eating the same amount of calories when they come from excessive fat. A high-fat diet also modulates genes associated with fat storage, making them more efficient at storing calories as fat in your body.

When you eat and digest food, the electrons stored in its fat, protein, and carbohydrates are converted by a part of your cells called mitochondria to provide energy for you. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells. Here, the electrons are combined with oxygen in your blood to make its energy available to you. These electrons travel in pairs, which keeps them stable. Unfortunately, this process is not perfect. Sometimes, one of these electrons becomes isolated from the other one and becomes what is called a free radical (not to be confused with Patty Hearst in her early days…). These are unstable molecules that need another electron to become stable and will do just about anything to get it, regardless of how much damage is done in the process. It appears that even electrons don’t like to be lonely! When unstable molecules “steal” electrons from other molecules throughout your body in order to stabilize themselves, this is called oxidation. This creates instability in these molecules and damages these cells in a process called oxidative stress.

Protein is essential to good health—including tissue growth and repair, digestion, metabolism, and the production of antibodies to fight infection. When you digest protein, it’s broken down into its component amino acids, which are then reassembled into over 50,000 different forms your body can use for hormones, enzymes, and neurotransmitters. Protein is formed from twenty-two different building blocks called amino acids in billions of different combinations, just as the twenty-six letters of the alphabet can combine to form a virtually endless number of words. Your body can make thirteen of these amino acids. The other nine are called “essential amino acids,” since they must be supplied in the diet.

In a good carb, the fiber and bran fill you up before you get too many calories. For example, you can only eat so many apples—you’ll get full before you eat too much. Also, fiber and bran slow the rate at which you absorb nutrients (including sugar) from your gut into your bloodstream. In contrast, you can consume large amounts of sugar, white rice, and white flour without getting full because you’ve removed the fiber and bran. Also, the food gets absorbed very quickly—it’s like injecting sugar into your veins—causing your blood sugar to spike. This, in turn, causes your pancreas to make more insulin. As we’ve discussed in Chapter 2, insulin creates chronic inflammation, one of the underlying mechanisms of most chronic diseases. And the repeated surges of insulin lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. And these wide swings in blood sugar produced by bad carbs help to make those foods addictive—since when your blood sugar is too low, it creates a craving for more sugar.

Choose a weight that allows you to do no fewer than eight and no more than fifteen repetitions per set. Do fewer reps with more weight to gain muscle size and strength; do more reps with less weight to gain muscle endurance. In either case, choose a weight that barely allows you to finish the last rep, as that’s where the beneficial effects are the greatest.

one of the easiest and quickest ways to control stress is to consciously breathe slowly and deeply. The practice of consciously guiding the direction, depth, and rhythm of your breath can restore, calm, and balance the nervous system, increase oxygen circulation in the blood, help increase awareness of internal states, and lower blood pressure and heart rate.

Meditation is the act of steadying your concentration on one object, such as your breath, a word, or a feeling. Meditation allows us to stay centered while we observe the natural ups and downs of the mind. The benefits of meditation also include better concentration, a more consistent feeling of calm, clarity, and a sharpened mind.

Reminders for Gentle Stretching   Move slowly and consciously, and never strain. Pay attention to the area being stretched. Stretch to a point before you feel pain, not beyond. Always keep your breath natural and through the nose whenever possible. Always remember to breathe smoothly and evenly during stretching postures. Full-body inhalations and exhalations help you to relax and stretch farther. The time you take for relaxing between the poses is as important as the postures themselves. Be aware of signs of stress—dizziness, shortness of breath, pain, and agitation. Use common sense. If it hurts, stop what you are doing. Hold each posture only as long as it feels comfortable. The goal is to feel peaceful and relaxed.

In meditation, you gently focus without forcing or trying. Stay open to all of your surroundings, and to the deepest parts of your inner experience. Your mind will rest on the object of your meditation (such as a word, a prayer, or the breath), and when it wanders away from that object, as it will—and this will happen most of the time when you’re beginning—the objective is to simply observe where it goes and, without any labels or judgments, gently return to your point of focus. The idea here is that you aren’t engaged in the process of thinking but rather are cultivating an attitude of “witnessing.” Notice what is arising and gently let it pass.

Processing whole-wheat flour into white flour or brown rice into white rice removes the fiber and bran. This turns healthy carbohydrates into unhealthy ones that promote inflammation. Fiber and bran fill you up before you get too many calories. Also, they slow the rate of absorption from your gut into your blood, so your blood sugar rises slowly and not too high. When fiber and bran are removed, your food gets rapidly absorbed, causing your blood sugar to spike to high levels, which in turn causes your pancreas to secrete insulin to bring your blood sugar back down. After a while, it’s as if these repeated surges of insulin cause your insulin receptors to say, “Oh, no, not more insulin!” so they downregulate and become less sensitive. Because of this, your body needs to make more and more insulin to lower your blood sugar an equivalent amount. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance also causes inflammation by increasing secretion of what are called cytokines from immune function cells. A vicious cycle results in which more insulin causes more inflammation, which causes more insulin resistance, often leading to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

It also takes a lot of energy to intervene with facts and truth and at the time the Chimp reacts we may not be able to think about the facts to settle it down. If we recall that the Chimp thinks quickly and is five times quicker than the Human, then the Human is constantly on catch-up with the Chimp.

But there is an easier way to manage the Chimp’s emotional reaction to any situation, which doesn’t involve the Human. As we have seen, the Computer thinks at twenty times the speed of the Human and four times the speed of the Chimp. Consequently, if we can get the Computer to act before the Chimp thinks then we will avoid the battle between the Human and the Chimp. In order to do this you need to have thought through what situations might happen and have a response programmed into the Computer ready to act.

Food processing began as a way to extend the shelf life of food by protecting it from these competitors. This is often accomplished by making the food less appealing to them, by removing nutrients from it that attract competitors, or by removing other nutrients likely to turn rancid, like omega-3 fatty acids. The more processed a food is, the longer the shelf life, and the less nutritious it typically is. Real food is alive - and therefore it should eventually die.

Nutritionism solves the problem of the fixed stomach, as it used to be cal ed in the business: the fact that compared to other consumer products, demand for food has in the past been fairly inelastic. People could eat only so much, and because tradition and habit ruled their choices, they tended to eat the same old things. Not anymore! Not only does nutritionism favor ever more novel kinds of highly processed foods (which are by far the most profitable kind to make), it actual y enlists the medical establishment and the government in the promotion of those products.

Refining grains extends their shelf life (precisely because they are less nutritious to the pests that compete with us for their calories) and makes them easier to digest by removing the fiber that ordinarily slows the release of their sugars. Also, the finer that flour is ground, the more surface area is exposed to digestive enzymes, so the quicker the starches turn to glucose.

The energy density of these refined carbohydrates contributes to obesity in two ways. First, we consume many more calories per unit of food; the fiber that’s been removed from these foods is precisely what would have made us feel ful and stop eating. Also, the flash flood of glucose causes insulin levels to spike and then, once the cel s have taken al that glucose out of circulation, drop precipitously, making us think we need to eat again.

With the result that today corn contributes 554 calories a day to America’s per capita food supply and soy another 257. Add wheat (768 calories) and rice (91) and you can see there isn’t a whole lot of room left in the American stomach for any other foods. Today these four crops account for two thirds of the calories we eat. When you consider that humankind has historical y consumed some eighty thousand edible species, and that three thousand of these have been in widespread use, this represents a radical simplification of the human diet. Why should this concern us? Because humans are omnivores, requiring somewhere between fifty and a hundred different chemical compounds and elements in order to be healthy. It’s hard to believe we’re getting everything we need from a diet consisting largely of processed corn, soybeans, rice, and wheat.

If a prize-winning mare gives birth to a foal with abnormally bowed legs, the veterinarian recognizes that something went wrong and, often, asks the logical question, What was the mother eating? But physicians rarely do that, even when life-threatening problems show up right at birth. And we continue to neglect the nutrition-development equation when our patients develop scoliosis, joint malformations, aneurysms, autism, schizophrenia, and so on later in life.

After your food is broken down by enzymes in the intestine, the fat and most other nutrients get absorbed into intestinal cells (called enterocytes). Here, fat and fat-soluble nutrients are prepared for circulation through the bloodstream. You can eat all the fat and cholesterol you want, and none of it will get into your arteries without first being wrapped inside a special layer of protein. When they’re working as designed, the special proteins suspend all the fats inside them in the solution of our bloodstream, and this is what prevents dietary fat from clogging our arteries. The resulting little blobs of fat wrapped in protein are called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are designed rather like microscopic M&Ms. Just as the candy’s coating prevents the chocolate inside it from getting all over your hands, the protein coat enables lipoproteins to circulate throughout your body without getting their messy insides smeared on your arterial walls.

The story of a heart attack, illustrated here, begins with degraded lipoproteins dropping out of circulation, landing on the lining of your blood vessels, where they attract a cleanup crew of white blood cells. But sometimes, during the cleanup procedure, oxygen ignites a free radical reaction so large that the underlying collagen is exposed to flowing blood. Whenever collagen contacts blood, clots form. If the clot is large enough to disrupt arterial flow, it may cause a heart attack, stroke, or venous thrombosis (a blood clot in your leg).

Oxidation reactions are ongoing in our bodies all the time. We breathe oxygen because, thanks to mitochondrial enzymes, we can harness the power of oxygen to turn fat and sugar into chemical energy with a high degree of efficiency. But nothing in this universe is 100 percent efficient. So sometimes oxygen goes about its business in our bodies without enzymatic supervision, generating random reactions that our bodies do not want. It’s these random oxidation reactions that rust and rot us slowly from the inside out, playing a primary role in the natural aging of the body. Wrinkles, stiffness, presbyopia (the loss of near vision resulting from a stiffening of the lens of the eye)—all the drawbacks of getting older—come at least in part from the accumulated damage of decades of oxidation reactions.

The two factors most powerfully impacting whether you spend your final decades living your life as you’d have it or lose yourself in the devastation of moderate or severe Alzheimer’s are: (1) the rate at which your brain is exposed to oxidative damage; and (2) your brain’s ability to control oxidative damage. 371 Every day of your life, your brain is engaged in a battle for control over oxidation, and the rate at which your brain ages depends largely on the daily balance of that battle. If oxidation wins the day, your brain is moved a little further toward premature aging.

Glycation: The Reason Sugar Is Bad for You Ever notice how licked lollipops and half-chewed taffy have a tacky feeling? Sugar feels sticky because, once dissolved in water, it reacts with proteins on the surface of your skin to form easily breakable chemical bonds. When you pull your fingers apart and feel that sticky resistance, you’re feeling the tug of those bonds being broken. The process by which sugar sticks to stuff is called glycation. Glycation reactions are reversible, but with enough heat or time, the temporary bonds become permanent due to oxidation reactions. The products of these later oxidation reactions are called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs. And that’s a useful acronym, because AGEs make you age unnaturally fast. When you toast bread, oxidation reactions generate AGEs in the proteins and sugars present in wheat. These AGEs change the bread from soft, pliable, and pale, to hard, stiff, and brown because the proteins and sugars form cross-links that stiffen the bread. The same thing happens inside your body as AGEs cross-link normally mobile proteins. This hardens your cells and tissues, making them brittle and stiff. Fortunately, at normal blood sugar levels, the reactions occur so slowly that cleanup crews of white blood cells keep them under control by breaking them down. The kidney cleans these AGEs from the blood and excretes them from the body. It is principally these waste chemicals that give urine its characteristic yellow color.

The clinical implications of having your tissues hardened by sugar- protein cross-links are vast and far-reaching. Cross-links turn the semi- permeable surfaces of arteries into impervious walls, preventing nutrients from exiting the bloodstream. When trapped nutrients can’t escape your bloodstream, where do you think they end up? Lining your arteries.

What are the nutritional benefits of our appetite for fat? For one thing, fat is a source of energy, like sugar. Unlike sugar, however, fat is a major building material for our cells, comprising 30 to 80 percent (dry weight) of our cell membranes. And unlike sugar, fat doesn’t trigger the release of insulin, which promotes weight gain.

To successfully avoid eating oxidized fats, you must avoid all foods containing vegetable oils. As I described in Chapter 7, vegetable oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, which are particularly prone to oxidation and readily deform into the collection of distorted fatty acids I call MegaTrans. And, as explained in Chapter 7, saturated fat resists oxidation—so much so that, in the body, it can help check inflammation before it gets too far out of control. Eating foods like butter, cream, and coconut oil can protect against some of the worst effects of oxidation and can actually help you lose weight.

One reason diets fail is that cutting back on calories without changing any other habits sends precisely the wrong message. The body presumes that the meager food intake, in combination with little activity, must mean food has become so scarce that you’ve given up looking for more. If it has the slightest chance to store surplus energy as fat, the panicked body reasons it had better do so. Under these circumstances, stem cells stand at the ready to convert themselves into more energy-storing fat cells. Frightening our stem cells into turning into fat cells is exactly the wrong thing to do.

metabolism of sugar to energy occurs in two stages. The first stage, called glycolysis, doesn’t require oxygen and is therefore an anaerobic process. It produces the starting material (pyruvic acid) for the second stage, along with some energy for your cells, called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The second stage uses oxygen to burn the products of the first reaction, and is therefore an aerobic process. The aerobic stage of sugar metabolism produces lots and lots of ATP. If the muscles don’t get enough oxygen to burn all that pyruvic acid, the acids start building up and you feel the burn, telling you your muscles are about to fail. And that’s a useful signal. If you were being chased by a lion, for example, the burning signal would warn you that your muscles were on the verge of seizing up. Time to start looking for a tree!Once the anaerobic activity is over, your metabolic management team furiously takes notes on the physiologic event that just took place, taking record of which muscles worked the hardest and will need to be tweaked for better performance in the future.

The plant starts out with low-energy electrons and, using the energy of the sun, charges them up into high-energy electrons. In this way, plants store the sun’s energy. When you then eat the plant (or the animals who ate the plant), these electrons (in the form of carbohydrates, protein, and fat) are delivered to all your cells. Then your mitochondria take the plant’s power-packed electrons and use them as an energy source—that is, as fuel—and slowly release their energy. Mind you, this process has to occur in a precise, tightly controlled manner, because these electrons are packed with energy and are therefore volatile, like gasoline.

You can slow down this oxidant process by eating foods containing lots of antioxidants. You can tell whether a food is rich in antioxidants by slicing it open, exposing it to air (oxygen), and then seeing what happens. If it turns brown, it’s oxidizing. Think about our two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn brown quickly, which means there aren’t a lot of antioxidants inside them. (Most of the antioxidants in apples are in the peels.) Cut open a mango and what happens? Nothing happens, because there are lots of antioxidants in there. How do you keep fruit salad from turning brown? By adding lemon juice, which contains the antioxidant vitamin C. Antioxidants can keep your food from oxidizing, and they may do the same inside your body.

By your sixties and seventies, when the damage can become apparent, it may already be too late. Like so many other organs, the brain possesses a miraculous ability to heal itself, to forge new synaptic connections around old ones, to learn and relearn. That is, however, if you don’t keep damaging it three times a day. A wholesome diet and exercise may offer your best hope for remaining sharp and healthy into your twilight years.

Think of insulin as the key that unlocks the doors to your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time you eat a meal, insulin is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the glucose into your cells. Without insulin, your cells can’t accept glucose, and, as a result, the glucose builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra sugar can damage the blood vessels throughout the body. That’s why diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, and stroke.

Here’s how type 2 diabetes develops: in a healthy person, the digestive system breaks food down into glucose. The beta cells in the pancreas make a hormone, insulin, which is released into the bloodstream and allows glucose to enter the body’s cells to be used as fuel. In a wonderfully tidy system, insulin binds to receptors on the cells, like a key fitting into a lock. The lock turns, the door opens, and glucose can enter the body’s cells. But too much belly or liver fat can cause your body to become insulin resistant, meaning that cells don’t respond to insulin the way they should. Their “locks” —the insulin receptors—gum up and stick; the key no longer fits as well. It’s harder for glucose to enter the cells. The glucose that can’t get in through the door remains in the bloodstream. Glucose builds up in the blood even as your pancreas churns out more and more insulin.

This idea—that improving your metabolic health is more important than losing weight—is vital, and that’s because repeated dieting takes a toll on your body. There are some internal “push back” mechanisms that makes it hard for us to keep weight off. Our body has a set point that it defends, and when we lose weight, we also slow our metabolism in an effort to regain the weight (“metabolic adaptation”).

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the intestines and occurs when gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, is ingested. When a person with Celiac disease consumes gluten, the protein is not broken down through the normal digestion process. It’s viewed as an enemy and is attacked by the immune system. Over time, the consumption of gluten damages the small intestine, specifically villi, the small fingerlike projections that assist in nutrient absorption. Damaged villi within the intestines will lead to less nutrient absorption and potential malnutrition.

Carbohydrates get broken down in the body to their simplest forms, a one-sugar molecule called glucose. Glucose is the preferred source of energy for your body, brain, and red blood cells. Your body can also store glucose, but first must transform it to what is called glycogen. About a third of glycogen resides in the liver. The liver also coverts the glycogen to glucose and releases it into the blood. Muscle tissue contains glycogen stores, too, which is what gives an athlete an extra burst of energy.

Inside the center or nucleus of each cell is a system set up like a tiny factory line whose job is to replicate DNA. This system can read the genetic information from DNA, then use this information to make an exact copy of the DNA in the form of messenger RNA. The messenger RNA (mRNA) carries all the instructions needed for making new proteins. Once formed, the mRNA leaves the center of the cell and moves to the outer part of the cell, called the cytoplasm. Located in the cytoplasm is another tiny factory system called ribosome whose job is to get all the instructions from the mRNA to make new proteins. Transfer RNA (tRNA) then gathers amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then uses the amino acids (from the tRNA) and instructions (from the mRNA) to make new proteins. These new proteins exactly match the specifications dictated by the mRNA. This new protein then is released from the ribosome and travels to its predetermined workplace.

A saturated fat is a type of fat that is solid at room temperature. “Saturated” refers to its chemical structure being made up of fatty acids heavily laden with hydrogen atoms, which allows for no double bonds between carbon molecules. The hydrogen atoms make the long fatty acid chain more stable because it’s difficult for other molecules to knock off a hydrogen atom and cause oxidation. Oxidation makes the fat go rancid.

Many parents think that when they judge and punish, they are teaching, as in “I’ll teach you a lesson you’ll never forget.” What are they teaching? They are teaching their children that if they go against the parents’ rules or values, they’ll be judged and punished. They’re not teaching their children how to think through the issues and come to ethical, mature decisions on their own. And chances are, they’re not teaching their children that the channels of communication are open.

Our minds automatically equate ‘I have X’ with ‘I deserve X’. When our eyes fall on those who lack the bare necessities, we immediately sympathize and express outrage that they do not have enough, but we do not for a moment allow ourselves to think that their deprivation may be the product of the same process that led to our affluence. This is the psychological mechanism that convinces the haves and those in power (who are usually the same people) that it is right, proper and necessary for them to have more while others have much less.

And here we encounter another irony that should provide some hope for humans in the race against machines. Employing humans always comes with the advantage that workers, unlike machines, recycle their wages, however small they may be, helping to ensure there is a market for the T-shirts and other products they assist in producing. By the same token, if those wages fall – as happens when work becomes more mechanical and less skilled – there will come a point when they are too low to support the sales of the goods they help produce.

The phenomenon we were studying is so common and so important in the everyday world that you should know its name: it is an anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor. If you are asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you wil end up with a much higher estimate of his age at death than you would if the anchoring question referred to death at 35.

Immersion is the process of surrounding yourself with the target environment in which the skill is practiced. This has the advantage of requiring much larger amounts of practice than would be typical, as well as exposing you to a fuller range of situations in which the skill applies. Learning a language is the canonical example of where immersion works. By immersing yourself in an environment where a language is spoken, not only do you guarantee that you’ll end up practicing the language a lot more than you would otherwise (since you have no choice), but you also face a broader diversity of situations that require learning new words and phrases.

another strategy for taking notes is to rephrase what you’ve recorded as questions to be answered later. Instead of writing that the Magna Carta was signed in 1215, you could instead write the question “When was the Magna Carta signed?” with a reference to where to find the answer in case you forget.

One of the pieces of studying advice that is best supported by research is that if you care about long-term retention, don’t cram. Spreading learning sessions over more intervals over longer periods of time tends to cause somewhat lower performance in the short run (because there is a chance for forgetting between intervals) but much better performance in the long run.

The second disadvantage is that recalling from mnemonics is often not as automatic as directly remembering something. Knowing a mnemonic for a foreign-language word is better than failing to remember it entirely, but it’s still too slow to allow you to fluently form sentences out of mnemonically remembered words. Thus mnemonics can act as a bridge for difficult-to-remember information, but it’s usually not the final step in creating memories that will endure forever.

However, as your skill develops, it’s often no longer enough to simply follow the examples of others; you need to experiment and find your own path. Part of the reason for this is that the early part of learning a skill tends to be the best trodden and supported, as everyone begins at the same place. As your skills develop, however, not only are there fewer people who can teach you and fewer students you could have as peers (thus lowering the total market for books, classes, and instructors), but you also start to diverge from those you’re learning from.

However, for many areas of creative or professional skills, another, more accessible, path is to combine two skills that don’t necessarily overlap to bring about a distinct advantage that those who specialize in only one of those skills do not have. For instance, you might be an engineer who becomes really good at public speaking. You may not be the best possible engineer or the best possible presenter, but combining those two skills could make you the best person to present on engineering topics for your company at conferences, thus giving you access to new professional opportunities.

Forgetting, as was discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus more than a hundred years ago, falls off with an exponentially decaying curve. That means that memories that are retained for longer are less and less likely to be forgotten when you follow up at a later date. This pattern suggests that maintenance practice, too, can fall off on a decaying rate, so that the bulk of the knowledge you’ve acquired will be preserved.

There are special receptors for sweetness in every one of the mouth’s ten thousand taste buds, and they are all hooked up, one way or another, to the parts of the brain known as the pleasure zones, where we get rewarded for stoking our bodies with energy. But our zeal doesn’t stop there. Scientists are now finding taste receptors that light up for sugar all the way down our esophagus to our stomach and pancreas, and they appear to be intricately tied to our appetites.

Who’s the worst person you can negotiate for? Yourself. You do a much better job negotiating for someone else. Why? Because you take yourself too seriously in any interaction that concerns you. You care too much about yourself. That puts you under pressure and stress. When you negotiate for someone else, you’re more relaxed. You’re more objective. You don’t care as much, because you regard the situation as fun or as a game—which it is.

the human body generally operates in 90-minute cycles, whether awake or asleep. This pattern is called the “ultradian rhythm.” The start of each cycle is defined as a period of “arousal,” ramping up to a mid-period of high performance before finally decelerating in a period of “stress.” Understanding how the 90-minute rhythm cycle works in the context of the greater 24-hour rhythm—the “circadian rhythm”—can help us predict how we’ll function over the course of a day and how we can plan around it for peak performance.

The first step is to preview. Don’t just dive in; rather, begin by trying to get a broad overview of what you’re doing, in what context, and why. See the big picture. What this looks like will depend on you and the subject you’re studying. For example, if you’re reading through an important chapter in a textbook, you might need to start with some skimming, i.e. read through the main headings and subheadings,

For a child to be open to being parented by an adult, he must be actively attaching to that adult, be wanting contact and closeness with him. At the beginning of life this drive to attach is quite physical—the infant literally clings to the parent and needs to be held. If everything unfolds according to design, the attachment will evolve into an emotional closeness and finally a sense of psychological intimacy.

Whether it is for our children to dress themselves, feed themselves, settle themselves, entertain themselves, think for themselves, solve their own problems, the story is the same: we champion independence—or what we believe is independence. We fear that to invite dependence is to invite regression instead of development, that if we give dependence an inch, it will take a mile. What we are really encouraging with this attitude is not true independence, only independence from us. Dependence is transferred to the peer group.

Many of the explanations for why we sleep circle around a common, and perhaps erroneous, idea: sleep is the state we must enter in order to fix that which has been upset by wake. But what if we turned this argument on its head? What if sleep is so useful—so physiologically beneficial to every aspect of our being—that the real question is: Why did life ever bother to wake up? Considering how biologically damaging the state of wakefulness can often be, that is the true evolutionary puzzle here, not sleep. Adopt this perspective, and we can pose a very different theory: sleep was the first state of life on this planet, and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged. It may be a preposterous hypothesis, but personally I do not think it to be entirely unreasonable.

If you compare the electrical depth of the deep NREM slow brainwaves on one half of someone’s head relative to the other when they are sleeping at home, they are about the same. But if you bring that person into a sleep laboratory, or take them to a hotel—both of which are unfamiliar sleep environments—one half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other, as if it’s standing guard with just a tad more vigilance due to the potentially less safe context that the conscious brain has registered while awake. The more nights an individual sleeps in the new location, the more similar the sleep is in each half of the brain. It is perhaps one reason why so many of us sleep so poorly the first night in a hotel room.

Analysis of the brain scans revealed the largest effects I have measured in my research to date. A structure located in the left and right sides of the brain, called the amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived. In contrast, the brain scans of those individuals who were given a full night’s sleep evinced a controlled, modest degree of reactivity in the amygdala, despite viewing the very same images. It was as though, without sleep, our brain reverts to a primitive pattern of uncontrolled reactivity. We produce unmetered, inappropriate emotional reactions, and are unable to place events into a broader or considered context.

Inadequate sleep and the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease interact in a vicious cycle. Without sufficient sleep, amyloid plaques build up in the brain, especially in deep-sleep-generating regions, attacking and degrading them. The loss of deep NREM sleep caused by this assault therefore lessens the ability to remove amyloid from the brain at night, resulting in greater amyloid deposition. More amyloid, less deep sleep, less deep sleep, more amyloid, and so on and so forth. From this cascade comes a prediction: getting too little sleep across the adult life span will significantly raise your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

Anaerobic energy is generated only with glucose (a simple sugar), and it’s quicker and easier for our bodies to access. It’s a kind of backup system and turbo boost when the body doesn’t have enough oxygen. But anaerobic energy is inefficient and can be toxic, creating an excess of lactic acid. The nausea, muscle weakness, and sweating you experience after you’ve pushed it too hard at the gym is the feeling of anaerobic overload. This process explains why the first few minutes of an intense workout are often so miserable. Our lungs and respiratory system haven’t caught up to supply the oxygen our bodies need, and so the body has to use anaerobic respiration. This also explains why, after we’re warmed up, exercise feels easier. The body has switched from anaerobic to aerobic respiration.

Finding the best heart rate for exercise is easy: subtract your age from 180. The result is the maximum your body can withstand to stay in the aerobic state. Long bouts of training and exercise can happen below this rate but never above it, otherwise the body will risk going too deep into the anaerobic zone for too long. Instead of feeling invigorated and strong after a workout, you’d feel tired, shaky, and nauseated.

A typical adult engages as little as 10 percent of the range of the diaphragm when breathing, which overburdens the heart, elevates blood pressure, and causes a rash of circulatory problems. Extending those breaths to 50 to 70 percent of the diaphragm’s capacity will ease cardiovascular stress and allow the body to work more efficiently. For this reason, the diaphragm is sometimes referred to as “the second heart,”

The cellular cruise ship is filled with “guest rooms.” In your blood cells, those rooms are the protein called hemoglobin. Oxygen takes a seat inside a hemoglobin; then the red blood cells journey upstream, deeper into the body. As blood passes through tissues and muscles, oxygen will disembark, providing fuel to hungry cells. As oxygen offloads, other passengers, namely carbon dioxide—the “waste product” of metabolism—will pile aboard, and the cruise ship will begin a return journey back to the lungs. This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide changes the appearance of blood. The blood cells in the veins that carry more carbon dioxide will appear blue; arterial blood, still filled with oxygen, will appear bright red. It’s these gases that give veins and arteries their distinctive colors.

When we breathe too much, we expel too much carbon dioxide, and our blood pH rises to become more alkaline; when we breathe slower and hold in more carbon dioxide, pH lowers and blood becomes more acidic. Almost all cellular functions in the body take place at a blood pH of 7.4, our sweet spot between alkaline and acid. When we stray from that, the body will do whatever it can to get us back there. The kidneys, for instance, will respond to overbreathing by “buffering,”* a process in which an alkaline compound called bicarbonate is released into the urine. With less bicarbonate in the blood, the pH lowers back to normal, even if we continue to huff and puff. It’s as if nothing ever happened. The problem with buffering is that it’s meant as a temporary fix, not a permanent solution. Weeks, months, or years of overbreathing, and this constant kidney (renal) buffering will deplete the body of essential minerals. This occurs because as bicarbonate leaves the body, it takes magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and more with it. Without healthy stores of these minerals, nothing works right: nerves malfunction, smooth muscles spasm, and cells can’t efficiently create energy. Breathing becomes even more difficult. This is one reason why asthmatics and other people with chronic respiratory problems are prescribed supplements like magnesium to stave off further attacks. Constant buffering also weakens the bones, which try to compensate by dissolving their mineral stores back into the bloodstream. (Yes, it’s possible to overbreathe yourself into osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fractures.)

What, then, triggers them to begin puberty? A few years ago, researchers discovered that puberty is initiated by what appears to be a game of hormonal dominoes, which begins with a gene producing a single protein, named kisspeptin, in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates metabolism. When that protein connects with, or “kisses,” receptors on another gene, it eventually triggers the pituitary gland to release its storage of hormones. Those surges of testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone in turn activate the testes and ovaries.

If you think of each neuron’s cell body as a point in a relay, there must be an incoming and an outgoing signal. Once the outgoing signal reaches the axonal bouton, or end point, it sets off a reaction causing the bouton to release packages of chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters. The point of contact between two neurons is called a synapse, and is actually a space no more than two-millionths of an inch wide. The synapse is truly where the action takes place in the brain. The signal heads down the neuron through the axon to the synapse and is then released as a chemical message. Like liquid keys, these neurotransmitters cross the synapse and lock onto the neuron on the other side, and in this way carry information from one cell to another. Once opened, the receptor causes a chain reaction of signals going down the receiving cell, triggering a pulse, or an action potential, which travels from a dendrite and through the cell body and out the axon toward another cell.

Dopamine is a special neurotransmitter because it is both excitatory and inhibitory. It is also, along with epinephrine and several others, a hormone. When it acts on the adrenal glands, it is acting hormonally; when it acts in the brain, it is a neurotransmitter. As a brain chemical messenger, dopamine helps motivate, drive, and focus the brain because it is integral to the brain’s reward circuitry. It’s the “I gotta have it” neurochemical that not only reinforces goal-directed activity but also can, in certain circumstances, lead to addiction. The more dopamine that is released in the brain, the more the reward circuits are activated, and the more those circuits are activated, the bigger the craving. It doesn’t matter if the craving is at the dinner table or the card table, in the boardroom or the bedroom. For instance, scientists know that high-calorie foods produce more dopamine in the brain. Why? Because higher calories increase our chance for survival. When we crave ice cream or gambling or sex, we may not actually be craving sweets, money, or orgasms. We’re craving dopamine.

Teenagers can be, and are, forced to abide by the adult chronotype, with early rising for school. However, this early rising does not result in an early bedtime: the teen brain doesn’t adjust at the other end of the day, and instead has a tendency to hold on to that part of its pattern. The result is a shrunken sleep period. However, on weekends, one sees teenagers immediately slip back into late-morning awakenings, as their internal clock prefers. If they are allowed to sleep as long as they like, teenagers will get around 9 to 10 hours of sleep per night. But if they are made to wake up for school, as shown in Figure 14, they are chronically losing 2.75 hours of sleep daily. This is thought to contribute to a chronic sleep deprivation syndrome.

Beginning at around ages ten to twelve, young people’s biological clock shifts forward, revving them up by about seven and eight o’clock at night and creating a “no sleep” zone around nine or ten o’clock at night, just when parents are starting to feel drowsy. One reason is that melatonin, a hormone critical to inducing sleep, is released two hours later at night in a teenager’s brain than it is in an adult’s. It also stays in the teenager’s system longer, and this is why it’s so hard to wake your high schooler up in the morning. Adults, on the other hand, have almost no melatonin in their system when they wake up and therefore don’t have the same groggy feeling.

During fMRI experiments, when adult subjects make an error, their cingulate cortex lights up as if to say, “Oh boy, I’d better make sure not to do that again.” This part of the brain is still being wired in teenagers, making it more difficult for them, even when they recognize a mistake, to learn from it.

Those who begin smoking in adolescence are also three times more likely to begin using alcohol, and long-term ingestion of nicotine has been shown to increase tolerance to alcohol, meaning it takes more alcohol to produce the same effect. Not surprisingly, smokers are ten times more likely than nonsmokers to develop alcoholism. For those teens who set off down this path, the effects of drinking are far more pronounced and the compulsion to do it again far greater than for adults who have recently decided to take this trip. Unfortunately, that compulsion, when coupled with an immature teenage cortex, frequently leads to catastrophic consequences.

Early teen users are twice as likely to become addicted, and those who indulge in pot before the age of sixteen have more trouble with focus and attention and make twice as many mistakes on tests involving planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking. Also, the younger a pot smoker is, the more he or she smokes. Bottom line: The earlier the use, the greater the abuse.

Recent research shows that fear of losing their parents’ trust and respect is the greatest deterrent to adolescents’ drug use. They won’t tell you this, of course, but when asked by researchers what prevents them from experimenting, a majority of non-drug-using teenagers say it’s because their parents expected them not to and that their parents would be disappointed in them if they did.

Craving and relapse are hallmarks of drug addiction, and teens get hooked on drugs harder and faster than adults precisely because so many of the drugs target the very active reward system in their brains. Because the nucleus accumbens is still maturing during adolescence, its functioning is characterized by a search for the highest excitement with the least amount of effort expended. In fact, it takes less than three months for adolescents to transition from experimentation to weekly use.

the brain responds to the hyperactivity of dopamine by reducing dopamine receptors, and a loss of receptors means less stimulation. The result is called tolerance. The addict must take increasingly larger doses of the drug to obtain the same high he or she experienced the first time around. And with the reward pathways so hypersensitized to being stimulated, withdrawal also comes quickly and is more pronounced than in adults, leaving the teenage drug abuser susceptible to anxiety, irritability, and depression and therefore even more determined to get high again.

Faced with a stressful situation, the amygdala is the first to respond, and when stimulated, it releases stress hormones that signal the pituitary gland to release certain chemicals, which then prompt the adrenal gland to release adrenaline (also known as epinephrine). The adrenal glands are located right above the kidneys, and when activated in highly stressful situations, they put the body in position to respond to danger by raising the heart rate, dilating blood vessels, increasing oxygen, and redirecting blood away from the digestive tract and into the muscles

Because the brain is so precious, it is protected not only by the skull and a bath of cerebrospinal fluid; the blood-brain barrier also effectively walls off the brain from the body’s blood supply. When working properly, this wall lets oxygen, glucose, and other necessary substances across the barrier but stops larger, sometimes toxic, molecules from getting into the brain. Gaps can form in this barrier, however, thereby letting harmful molecules enter the brain and accumulate. The result is a gradual swelling of the brain, which increases the pressure inside the cranium and inhibits blood flow to the brain.

In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, a person cannot make insulin because the body has killed the specialized cells in the pancreas needed to make insulin. For this reason, those with type 1 diabetes have to inject themselves with insulin to make up for their lack of being able to produce the substance on their own. Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by chronic high blood sugar that causes dramatic surges in insulin so high that cells become desensitized to the hormone.

the brain begins to age in one’s mid-twenties and can structurally begin to deteriorate as early as age thirty. After age forty, the hippocampus shrinks by about 0.5 percent per year. This shrinkage, however, is quite variable among individuals and heavily depends on lifestyle choices, environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and medical conditions. These factors have an impact on the hippocampus more than any other part of the brain.

Long before humans walked the earth, plants protected themselves and their offspring from hungry insects by producing toxins, including lectins, in the plants’ seeds and other parts. It turns out the same plant toxins that can kill or immobilize an insect can also silently destroy your health and insidiously impact your weight. I titled this book The Plant Paradox because while many plant foods are good for you—and form the bedrock of my eating plan—others that have been regarded as “health foods” are actually to blame for making you sick and overweight. That’s right, most plants actually want to make you ill. Another paradox: small portions of some plants are good for you but large amounts are bad for you.

when you buy fruit in North America in December, it was likely grown in Chile or another country in the Southern Hemisphere, picked slightly unripe, and then given a blast of ethylene oxide when it arrived at its destination. The ethylene oxide exposure changes the color to make the fruit appear ripe and ready to eat, but the lectin content remains high because the protective coating of the seed never fully matured and the fruit never got the message from the parent plant to reduce the lectin content. Again, when fruit is allowed to ripen naturally, the parent plant reduces the amount of lectins surrounding the seeds in the fruit and skin and then communicates this information by changing color. In contrast, gassing artificially changes the color of the fruit, but the lectin protection system remains in effect. Thanks to the high lectin count, eating fruit picked too early is detrimental to your health.

There is no advantage to being carried off, so the plant must discourage insects or other animals from consuming its babies and transporting them elsewhere. Instead of a hard casing, the naked seed contains one or more chemicals that weaken predators, paralyze them, or make them ill, so they won’t make the mistake of eating the plant again. These substances include phytates, often referred to as antinutrients, which prevent absorption of minerals in the diet; trypsin inhibitors, which keep digestive enzymes from doing their job, interfering with the predator’s growth; and lectins, which are designed to disrupt cellular communication by, among other things, causing gaps in the intestinal wall barrier, a condition known as leaky gut. Whole grains actually contain all three of these defensive chemicals in the fibrous hull, husk, and bran.

LECTIN ATTACK STRATEGY #3: Disrupt Cellular Communication Some lectins also disrupt transmissions between your cells by mimicking or blocking hormonal signals. 18 Hormones are proteins that fit into actual docking ports on the walls of all cells and release information about what the hormone wants a cell to do. For example, the hormone insulin enables cells to allow glucose to enter and provide fuel. If there is excess glucose, insulin attaches to fat cells and directs them to store the glucose as fat for use when there’s less food. Once the hormone releases information, the cell informs the hormone that the message has been received and the hormone backs out of the dock, so the dock is ready for the next hormone. In order to do any of these things, the docking port for insulin has to be open and available. However, lectins can bind to important docking ports on cell walls, either giving wrong information or blocking release of the correct important docking ports on cell walls, either giving wrong information or blocking release of the correct information. For example, the lectin WGA bears a striking resemblance to insulin. 19 It can attach to the insulin docking port as if it were the actual insulin molecule, but unlike the real hormone, it never lets go—with devastating results, including reduced muscle mass, starved brain and nerve cells, and plenty of fat. Ouch!

Gluten (gliadin specifically) is bad for you because gliadin triggers an excessive release of zonulin, which causes the tight junctions between the intestinal cells to open wider, producing a leaky gut. As we have discussed, zonulin is a protein in charge of opening and closing the tiny barriers in the gut wall. So the more zonulin release you have, the more inflammation and potential for an autoimmune response you will have as a direct result.

When lectins get through the gut wall, they activate the immune system, which starts shooting without first asking questions—and that means it may shoot both at the lectins and also at the critical structures that resemble the lectins.

The fact that neurons require insulin to get glucose is a relatively new finding, and we now know that insulin resistance also occurs in the brain and nerves—it is called type 3 diabetes.

mitochondria cannot process fat directly from your fat cells. Instead, an enzyme called hormone-sensitive lipase has to turn your stored fat into a usable form of fat called a ketone. Your body works in elegant ways. Insulin is the single hormone to which this enzyme is sensitive. So, if your insulin level is high, your brain assumes that you must be chowing down for the coming winter, converting everything you eat into fat to tide you over when pickings are slim. And it assumes that the last thing you want to do right then is convert that fat into ketones. So, insulin keeps hormone-sensitive lipase from working. On the other hand, if it’s winter and you’re not eating much, hormone-sensitive lipase is unblocked because there is no insulin being produced—and away you go, making ketones

You inherited both your gut buddies and your mitochondria from your mother. As a refresher, mitochondria are engulfed bacteria that live in all your cells. They contain their own mitochondrial DNA (genes) that actually divide separately from the rest of the cell’s DNA contained in the nucleus. (Didn’t you just love high school biology?) All mitochondrial DNA is transmitted through the female egg from mother to child. So all mitochondria and their DNA are female. Likewise, your mother initially populated your gut microbiome at birth with her bacteria as you traveled down the birth canal and were exposed to the bacteria in her vagina. This elegant system continued even further when your mother nursed you for the first time. Amazingly, her milk contained specific sugar molecules called oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides that you couldn’t digest but were the exact type of food the gut buddies she’d just passed onto you liked best. In other words, Mom was feeding two infants at once: you and your newly introduced (from her) microbiome.

Your stomach acids, enzymes, and gut buddies break down the food you eat into individual components: amino acids (from protein), fatty acids (from fat), and sugar molecules (from sugars and starches). Your mucosal cells then literally bite off a single molecule of these digested amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars, pass it through the body of the cell, and release it into your portal vein or lymph system.

Normally, when the cells in your gut bite off a single molecule of sugar and pass it into the bloodstream, the pancreas responds by secreting insulin, a hormone that regulates the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Insulin works by opening the door to your cells and allowing glucose to enter. The mitochondria in both muscle cells and neurons then “digest” the glucose, using oxygen to create energy. When there is more glucose available than your muscles need (and if you are sitting all day, they don’t need much!), insulin attaches to a docking port on the cell membrane of fat cells and flips an enzymatic switch called lipoprotein lipase that tells the fat cell to convert that glucose to fat and store it in the cell. No matter what type of cell, once the insulin has done its job of ushering glucose inside, the insulin separates from the docking port so the cell is ready to receive the next hormonal signal.

No matter what type of cell, once the insulin has done its job of ushering glucose inside, the insulin separates from the docking port so the cell is ready to receive the next hormonal signal. This system goes completely awry when WGA is absorbed after you eat whole wheat products. WGA locks onto the insulin hormonal docking port on the cell membrane, but unlike a “normal” hormone, which would dock, release its information, and leave, WGA doesn’t let go. Instead, it keeps the switch open. This causes fat cells to continue ushering in more and more sugar to store as fat. In contrast, in muscle cells, real insulin cannot dock at the port because it is blocked by the WGA. This means that your mitochondria can’t get the glucose they need to create energy. Without energy, your cells die. Many people assume that muscle wasting is a normal part of aging, but that is not the case. This insulin mimicry is one of the main causes of muscle wasting as we age because muscle cells die when they cannot get glucose for energy. But don’t panic; muscles and the rest of you have a backup power supply that we’ll get to shortly. Worst of all, WGA locks onto the docking port of nerve cells, starving them of energy, too. Your brain needs a lot of energy to function. So when sugar is locked out of your neurons, your brain responds angrily, demanding that you eat more food. Of course, your brain cells don’t understand that the sugar from any food you eat will just continue to go straight into your fat cells because the insulin docks on all of your other cells are being blocked. No matter how much you eat, your muscle and brain cells will starve and your fat cells will feast.

About two thousand years ago, a spontaneous mutation in northern European cows changed the type of protein in their milk from casein A2 to casein A1. During digestion, casein A1 can turn into beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide53 that attaches to the pancreas’s insulin-producing cells and prompts an immune attack (and thus inflammation). This is likely a primary cause of type 1 diabetes.

When you eat excess starch or sugars (or protein, which we’ll discuss in a moment) anything you don’t need for immediate fuel is carried to your liver, where it is transformed into a fat called a triglyceride. Then you need moving vans, which are low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), a type of cholesterol, to carry triglycerides from the liver to cells throughout your body. Once distributed there, they’ll be stored as fat or used to make hormones.

And in fact, eating protein also raises triglyceride levels. Believe it or not, you have no real storage system for protein. Your body needs protein for maintenance of cell membranes and intracellular structures and when you are actively building muscle, but it converts any excess protein into sugar, because you do have a storage system for sugar. This process of converting protein into sugar is called gluconeogenesis. And if you make too much sugar, bingo!—you simply convert that into fat or triglycerides. This is why many people who turn to high-protein diets struggle with high triglyceride levels and insulin resistance. The real trick is to avoid high triglycerides by avoiding the consumption of excess animal protein and simple starches.

Again it goes back to the 365-days-a-year growth cycle in which we currently live that is so rich with opportunity for cancer cell growth. When your microbiome and your cells’ energy sensor, mTOR, send the signal that food is plentiful and your cells should prioritize growth, there is no opportunity for your body to take stock and prune any cells that look odd or dysfunctional. This is a deadly problem—literally—because we have abnormal cells all the time. It is normal to have abnormal cells. What is not normal is constantly encouraging those abnormal cells to grow by feeding them an endless abundance of energy (aka food). You absolutely must give your body a chance to reset and prune those abnormal cells by regularly but temporarily restricting your energy intake. Ironically, it’s restricting energy that allows your mitochondria to more effectively produce energy for your healthy, noncancerous cells. Right now, your mitochondria are constantly working to produce energy from the molecules of food sent to them by their gut buddy sisters. But it’s very difficult for them to keep up. Remember, when you eat sugar or protein, your pancreas releases insulin to usher sugar into cells so it can be processed by your mitochondria. But if each cell’s receiving dock is already full, insulin has to put the extra sugar somewhere—and it ends up being stored as fat for later use. This is a great system, but if you keep eating sugar, protein, or WGA (which, as you read earlier, binds to those loading docks), your pancreas has to keep producing more and more insulin to convert the sugar to fat. This is the root cause of insulin resistance, but it also leads to excess glucose molecules that are free for the taking. And guess who wants to take this sugar and use it to grow? Cancer cells. And guess what stimulates them to grow? Insulin! Insulin is another growth hormone; it’s Miracle Grow to cancer cells.

Remember, your body produces ketones when insulin levels are low and sugar and protein are in short supply—during times of regression—and cancer cells thrive on sugar. Cancer cells are also unwilling to utilize sugar molecules to produce energy the way regular cells do when insulin levels are high. Strangely, the mitochondria in cancer cells create energy only through the extremely inefficient system of sugar fermentation. As a result, the average cancer cell needs up to eighteen times as much sugar to grow and divide as normal cells.27 It’s therefore very easy to starve cancer cells to death. They cannot grow and thrive without lots and lots of sugar.

So what can you do to make your muscles hungrier? You’ve probably already guessed that the answer is exercise—specifically, strength-training exercises that grow muscle mass. When you exercise your muscles, they get hungry and start screaming for food. This makes it easy for insulin to sell them sugar instead of storing it as fat.

researchers discovered a system that allows cerebrospinal fluid (that clear fluid that we tap when we stick a needle into your spine) to flow through the brain, cleaning out the spaces in between cells, just as lymphatic fluid does in the rest of your body. This is called the glymphatic system. To make room for the fluid to wash out your brain, your cells actually shrink in size when you are in a deep sleep. This allows the full “brain wash” process to go twenty times as fast when you are in deep sleep as when you are awake and helps to explain why a good night’s sleep is so restorative.19 When you get an adequate amount of deep sleep, you literally wake up with a refreshed and rejuvenated mind that has been swept clean of junk and debris.

Fast-Mimicking Days Five consecutive days a month, you will eliminate animal protein and limit calories to 900 a day to mimic the benefits of a whole month of full-time calorie restriction. Free Days On most days, you will eat as much as you like of your gut buddies’ favorite Longevity Paradox foods. Brain-Wash Days Once or twice a week, you will skip dinner or eat it very early to make sure your brain is scrubbed completely clean while you sleep. Optional Calorie Restriction Days If you choose, you will consume only 600 calories a day once or twice a week to get extra longevity benefits. This can even be done on brain-wash days for a double benefit. Optional Intensive Care Cleanse If you are suffering from degenerative problems or want to kick-start the process, this program, which includes more fasting and brain-wash days, will give your mitochondrial function an extra boost.

Dopamine isn’t the pleasure molecule, after all. It’s the anticipation molecule. To enjoy the things we have, as opposed to the things that are only possible, our brains must transition from future-oriented dopamine to present-oriented chemicals, a collection of neurotransmitters we call the Here and Now molecules, or the H&Ns. Most people have heard of the H&Ns.

The cell is nature’s basic building block of life. Each of us is composed of ten trillion cells, most of them specialized and residing in different organs. In order to stay alive, a cell has to burn energy. Any cell can (and normally does) burn glucose, a simple sugar and the building block of starch. The liver and adipose (fat) tissue need the hormone insulin (released from the pancreas) to open the metabolic door within the membrane, the bag that holds the cell together, to let the glucose enter the cell; however, other organs don’t need insulin for glucose entry. But if glucose is in short supply and insulin levels are low, then adipose tissue will give up some of its stored fatty acids to enter the bloodstream, and the liver will turn those fatty acids into ketones, which then seep back into the bloodstream, so that any cell can burn those ketones instead, even without insulin.

Cells are magicians. They either make glucose disappear, or if there’s too much, then presto-change-o, they turn glucose into fat, which wreaks havoc on metabolism. But how and when is the key. Once inside the cell (Fig. 7–1), glucose undergoes breakdown through a series of metabolic steps called glycolysis to the intermediate pyruvic acid, releasing only a small amount of energy, which is captured within a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). From there, the pyruvic acid has one of two choices: 1) either enter the mitochondria (the energy-burning factories inside the cell), where the metabolic breakdown continues, a process called the Krebs cycle, to yield a lot more ATP (and making the waste product carbon dioxide, which you breathe out from the lungs); or 2) if the mitochondria are busy or dysfunctional, the pyruvic acid diverts to a process called de novo lipogenesis (new fat-making) to turn into a fatty acid called palmitic acid, which is then bound to a glycerol molecule and exported out of the liver cell as a triglyceride particle. These two pathways of energy metabolism, especially within the mitochondria, consistently release toxic by-products inside the cell called oxygen radicals (kind of like what hydrogen peroxide does on a wound). If not detoxified, these can damage the cell, and even cause it to die. Therefore, the cell has another structure called a peroxisome, which is where various antioxidants are stored to neutralize the oxygen radicals.

Glycation Why do we get cataracts and wrinkles as we get older? Each of these is an example of an undeniable and inevitable fact of life—the Maillard or glycation or browning or caramelization reaction. All four terms describe the same process, which is the primary process of aging. First described by Professor Louis Camille Maillard in 1912, this process occurs in all living cells. It doesn’t need any energy or enzymes or cofactors or other nutrients, it just happens. It’s a by-product of living, yet it’s the primary reason for dying. We’re all browning, all the time, and the only way to stop it is by dying. The faster the Maillard reaction occurs, the faster you age—you get wrinkles, your arteries become sclerotic, and you eventually reach the pearly gates. But you can slow this process down—and if you’re successful, you’ll be a lot healthier for a lot longer. The Maillard reaction only needs two molecules to occur: a carbohydrate (fructose or glucose), plus an amino acid (e.g., proteins). Put them together and the protein starts to “brown” and become less flexible. Ideally, these damaged proteins will be cleared away by cellular waste processing systems, but if the reaction occurs faster than the waste can be cleared, eventually the buildup of advanced glycation end products, or AGEs, will lead to cell, organ, and human dysfunction. The question is not if the Maillard reaction will occur, but rather how fast. And this is where the metabolic differences between glucose and fructose becomes important (see Chapters 2 and 12). One might think that glucose and fructose, both being molecules found in dietary sugar (sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, agave—they’re all metabolically the same; take your pick), would drive this reaction at the same rate. You would be very wrong. Yes, they’re both carbohydrates, and yes, they both bind to proteins, but that’s where their similarities end. Because glucose has a six-member-ring structure (see Fig. 7–2), it’s more stable and engages in the Maillard reaction relatively slowly. Conversely, fructose’s five-member ring is more easily broken apart, and engages in the Maillard reaction seven times faster than glucose. It also generates one hundred times the number of oxygen radicals (see Oxidative Stress below). Furthermore, our research group has shown that a specific breakdown product of fructose, called methylglyoxal, drives the Maillard reaction 250 times faster than glucose. All in all, when it comes to aging, fructose is worse than glucose, and therefore sugar is worse than starch. That doesn’t make glucose “good”—it raises insulin and drives obesity—but compared to fructose, it’s a walk in the park.

Inside our white blood cells, oxygen undergoes a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called superoxide dismutase (SOD), which turns O2 (the stuff we breathe) into O2—, an oxygen radical or reactive oxygen species, similar to how water (H20) can be turned into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When you put hydrogen peroxide on a wound, it bubbles and fizzes as the liberated oxygen radicals kill everything in sight. And that’s great if you’re cleaning a wound. But this process occurs in all of our cells all of the time. Oxygen radicals are a standard by-product of three normal reactions in the body: glycation; energy metabolism in our mitochondria; and iron metabolism (equivalent to rusting, which is constantly occurring in all of our cells). Furthermore, oxygen radicals are formed in response to anything that causes inflammation. Thus, each cell in our body ordinarily has to deal with an oxygen radical pool; if unleashed they would kill us pretty quickly. Each of our cells possesses specialized subcellular organelles called peroxisomes, which is where antioxidants lie in wait to quench incoming oxygen radicals and render them inert (see Chapter 19). But if there are more oxygen radicals than antioxidants (termed oxidative stress), it causes cellular dysfunction, structural damage to lipids, proteins, or DNA, and in the extreme, cell death. When this happens in the liver and the pancreas, you get diabetes. It’s also why we need to consume Real Food that has color, because color is an indication that these plants contain the antioxidants we can’t make on our own.

Mitochondria are really bacteria that decided eons ago that they were happier living inside of animal-based cells than facing the cold, cruel world on their own. Bacteria were great at burning energy, while animal cells were great at fending off invaders—so they made a symbiotic decision to stick together. To this day, mitochondria have their own DNA and their own genetic program apart from the human DNA found in the nucleus of the cell. But like the shift workers, mitochondria tend to go defective with time and are prone to oxidative stress and damage. Mitochondria are finicky, lose capacity easily, and constantly need to be renewed and replenished. They need to divide, and the cell needs to clear the old ones out.

When glucose and oxygen availability, as well as mitochondrial capacity, are all matched, everything goes smoothly. Using the coal factory analogy, when the glucose comes in faster than the mitochondria (stokers) process it, the excess chokes off the factory. The mitochondria have no choice but to divert the excess pyruvic acid into fat, a process called de novo lipogenesis (new fat-making). When this happens in the liver, you get fatty liver, which leads to liver insulin resistance (see Insulin Resistance below). If instead this happens in the pancreas, you get fatty pancreas and insulin deficiency. And fructose (in processed food) makes twice as much liver fat as does glucose.

That’s what sleep is for—our intracerebral pressure goes down during sleep, which opens small pores within the brain called glymphatics. An ebb tide fluid shifts slowly during sleep to remove damaged cellular components into the bloodstream for disposal. In other words, in the brain, every night is garbage night. And if you don’t get enough sleep, it’s like having your brain’s garbagemen on strike. But this isn’t just good for the brain—all organs do better with autophagy, which is an essential process that maintains healthy cells by removing damaged proteins and malfunctioning organelles, especially mitochondria. Old mitochondria make a lot of oxygen radicals. Therefore, to improve metabolism and slow aging, it’s essential to get rid of the old mitochondria by autophagy.

The first pathway is called glycolysis (see Chapter 7), which prepares glucose to be used for structural components, and pyruvic acid is the end product. If the pyruvic acid is not used for burning in the next stage, it can leave the cell as lactic acid. Glycolysis provides the added bonus of generating a grand total of two ATPs, all without needing oxygen. The second pathway is called the Krebs cycle (see Chapter 7). The pyruvic acid enters the mitochondria, where it burns all the way to completion, at the end of which you have twenty-eight ATPs and carbon dioxide. If the goal is burning (e.g., aerobic exercise), you need both glycolysis and the Krebs cycle working in tandem. If the goal is structural components for growth (e.g., blood flow restriction, or bodybuilders using high-intensity interval training to build muscle mass), then you only need glycolysis, and the pyruvic acid will be diverted for building muscle.

When a cell has used up its ATPs, the mitochondria need to burn pyruvic acid completely, to generate twenty-eight new ATPs to replete the cell’s energy stores (with the waste product of carbon dioxide). AMP-kinase has the added bonus of signaling the cell to make more mitochondria in order to burn more glucose to make even more ATP. Anything that gooses AMP-kinase, like exercise or the anti-diabetes drug metformin, will keep mitochondria functioning optimally and improve insulin sensitivity. But on the other hand, when a cell has too much ATP, AMP-kinase gets turned off. Mitochondria aren’t burning, and the cell will divert the pyruvic acid to make structural components. Anything that impairs AMP-kinase will drive fat synthesis and worsen insulin resistance. And what food impairs AMP-kinase the most? Sugar, of course.

Two-thirds of the US populace continue to believe and perpetuate the myth that “fat makes you fat.” While it’s true that dietary fat could become body fat, it does so only in response to insulin. And so weight isn’t driven by dietary fat, which doesn’t raise insulin, but rather by dietary refined carbohydrate and sugar, which do.

there are two types of fiber—soluble and insoluble—and you need both. The reason you hear doctors espousing a plant-based diet isn’t because of the plant origin per se; it’s because plants come with both types of fiber. Together, the two kinds of fiber form a gel on the inside of the duodenum, reducing intestinal absorption by 25 to 30 percent, thus protecting the liver. Reciprocally, a sizeable portion of what you eat stays in the intestine, where the bacteria can feast on it and grow, thus feeding the gut.

Almost all foodstuffs have various unique proteins, or antigens, on their surfaces. The enzymes in the intestine break these proteins down completely into their component amino acids, which are then absorbed and go to the liver. But if a protein gains access to the bloodstream before it’s completely dismantled, its structure will be recognized by the immune system as foreign and will generate an immune response.

Wheat is a complex organism—it’s hexaploid (six nuclei) instead of diploid (two nuclei). It’s been selectively bred to cultivate certain traits—among them higher gluten content, which means better bread because gluten is “sticky” and therefore rises better, making a fluffier loaf. Wheat also has seven hundred different proteins you could have an intolerance to—only two of them are the ones in gluten. The other 698 are just as capable of generating an immune reaction. This is why there’s no biomarker in the blood for it; there are too many suspects.

Dietary sugar is composed of two molecules: glucose and fructose. Fructose, while an energy source (4 kcal/gram), is otherwise vestigial to humans; again, there’s no biochemical reaction that requires it. However, fructose is metabolized in the liver in exactly the same way as alcohol. That’s why, when consumed chronically and in high doses, fructose is similarly toxic and abused, unrelated to its calories or effects on weight. That’s why our children now get the diseases of alcohol (type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease), without ever taking a drink.

Mother’s, cow’s, and other mammalian milks contain a special sugar called lactose, which is composed of two molecules—glucose and galactose bound together. You hear a lot about lactose because many people lack the enzyme that breaks the bond between the two molecules, a condition called lactose intolerance; affected individuals experience diarrhea, pain, and gas in response to milk or dairy consumption. However, you don’t hear much about galactose. When an adult consumes galactose, it goes straight to the liver and is converted immediately to glucose. Many adults don’t drink milk, and adults have no need for galactose. So why does it exist? Why is it important? Why is it exclusively in mammalian milk? Milk is food for babies; and babies, even more than children or adults, need to grow two parts of the body—the brain and the immune system. Galactose is an essential component of certain fats in the brain called cerebrosides and ceramides. Furthermore, the mammary gland is the only part of the human body that can make galactose, in order to properly feed the infant.

sucking on mother’s nipple is far better than sucking on a plastic one. The infant has to suck harder to make a seal, and this action strengthens and grows the sixteen muscles of the tongue. The well-developed tongue then applies continuous pressure against the hard palate of infants so that it’s broad and flat (mimicking the shape of the tongue), thereby creating a larger space in the mouth and a wider airway. A low, lazy tongue means that the palate narrows and develops a high arch.

The key lesson to digest from the starving men’s dramatically lower resting metabolic rates is that human resting metabolisms are flexible. Most critically, resting metabolism is what the body has opted to spend on maintenance, not what it needs to spend. One of the main ways the starving volunteers spent less energy was to skimp on maintenance. Basically, their metabolisms slowed down and cut back on costly physiological processes that keep the body in a state of balance.

As the day marches on, we store memories in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which functions as a short-term storage center like a USB drive. Then, during NREM sleep, the brain triages these memories, rejecting the innumerable useless ones (like what color socks the man sitting next to me on the subway wore) and sending the important ones to long-term storage centers near the surface of the brain. The brain apparently also tags and sorts memories, identifying and strengthening ones we may need. And, fantastically, the brain may also analyze certain memories during REM sleep, integrating them and looking for patterns.

To rid itself of waste, the brain evolved a novel plumbing system that relies on sleep. During NREM sleep, specialized cells throughout the brain expand the spaces between neurons by as much as 60 percent, allowing cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain to literally flush away this junk.16 These opened spaces also admit enzymes that repair damaged cells and rejuvenate receptors in the brain for neurotransmitters.17 The only catch, however, is that the brain’s interstitial pathways are like single-lane bridges that let cars pass in only one direction at a time. Apparently, we cannot think while cleansing our brains. We thus must sleep to flush out the cobwebs left behind by the day’s experiences. Sleep is therefore a necessary trade-off that improves brain function at the cost of time. For every hour spent awake storing memories and amassing waste, we need approximately fifteen minutes asleep to process those memories and clean up.

These cells wake us up in the morning by signaling to the glands atop our kidneys to produce cortisol, the major hormone that stimulates the body to spend energy. Then as darkness falls, the hypothalamus directs the pineal gland, another structure in the brain, to produce melatonin, the “Dracula hormone,” which helps induce sleep. Clocklike, the circadian system is re-synced every day by light levels and other experiences.

Sugar is synonymous with sweetness, but it’s first and foremost a fuel used to recharge ATPs through a process termed glycolysis (from glyco for “sugar” and lysis for “break down”). During glycolysis, enzymes swiftly snip sugar molecules in half, liberating the energy from those bonds to charge two ATPs.19 Restoring ATPs from sugar doesn’t require oxygen and is rapid enough to provide almost half the energy used during a thirty-second sprint.20 In fact, a fit human can store enough sugar to run nearly fifteen miles. But there is a consequential catch: during glycolysis the leftover halves of each sugar, molecules known as pyruvates, accumulate faster than cells can handle. As pyruvates pile up to intolerable levels, enzymes convert each pyruvate into a molecule called lactate along with a hydrogen ion (H+). Although lactate is harmless and eventually used to recharge ATPs, those hydrogen ions make muscle cells increasingly acidic, causing fatigue, pain, and decreased function.

Life demands oxygen, especially if you want to run far. In fact, using oxygen to burn a molecule of sugar yields a whopping eighteen times more ATP than glycolysis. But, once again, there is a trade-off: aerobic metabolism provides substantially more energy but substantially more slowly because it requires a long sequence of steps and an army of enzymes.22 These steps occur within specialized structures in cells known as mitochondria that are capable of burning not only the pyruvates that come from sugar but also fats and, in emergencies, proteins. Sugars and fats, however, are burned at different rates. Although my body stores enough fat to run about thirteen hundred miles, fat takes many more steps, hence much more time, to break down and burn than sugar. At rest, about 70 percent of a body’s energy comes from slowly burning fat, but the faster we run, the more sugar we must burn. At maximum aerobic capacity we burn exclusively sugar.

According to this idea, human longevity was not only selected for but also made possible by having to work moderately during old age to help as many children, grandchildren, and other younger relatives as possible to survive and thrive. That is, while there might have been selection for genes (as yet unidentified) that help humans live past the age of fifty, there was also selection for genes that repair and maintain our bodies when we are physically active. As a result, many of the mechanisms that slow aging and extend life are turned on by physical activity, especially as we get older.

The oxygen we breathe generates energy in cells but leaves behind unstable oxygen molecules with free, unpaired electrons. These reactive oxygen species (charmingly also called free radicals) steal electrons indiscriminately from other molecules, thereby “oxidizing” them. That theft sets off a slow chain reaction by creating other unstable, electron-hungry molecules obliged to steal electrons from yet more molecules. Oxidation burns things gradually and steadily. Just as oxidation causes metal to rust and apple flesh to brown, it damages cells throughout the body by zapping DNA, scarring the walls of arteries, inactivating enzymes, and mangling proteins.

Because too much sugar is toxic to many cells, excess sugar stimulates your pancreas to release the hormone insulin, whose basic function is to cause the body to store energy. Among its many actions, insulin directs special molecules on the surfaces of fat and muscle cells to transport sugar from the bloodstream into those cells to be stored or burned. Type 2 diabetes arises when the effects of metabolic syndrome prevent insulin receptors on these cells from binding with insulin (a phenomenon termed resistance). A vicious cycle ensues. When insulin binding doesn’t happen, the glucose transporters don’t take up sugar from the bloodstream. Then, as blood sugar levels rise, the brain desperately commands the pancreas to produce yet more insulin, but with diminishing effect, causing blood sugar levels to stay dangerously high. Symptoms include frequent thirst and peeing, nausea, tingly skin, and swollen feet. Eventually, the overworked pancreas fails, requiring injections of insulin to avoid death.

Plaques, however, don’t simply accumulate in arteries like crud settling in a pipe. Instead, they are dynamic, changing, growing, shifting, and sometimes breaking. They develop when white blood cells in arteries trigger inflammation by reacting to damage usually caused by a combination of high blood pressure and so-called bad cholesterol that irritates the walls of the artery. In an effort to repair the damage, white blood cells produce a foamy mixture that incorporates cholesterol and other stuff and then hardens.

The first is low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often termed bad cholesterol. Your liver produces these balloon-like molecules to transport fats and cholesterol throughout your bloodstream, but some LDLs have a harmful tendency to burrow into the walls of arteries, especially when blood pressure is high. These intrusions cause an inflammatory reaction that generates plaques. The second type of cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein (HDL), sometimes called good cholesterol, because these molecules scavenge and return LDLs back to the liver. The third type are triglycerides, fat molecules that are floating freely in the bloodstream and a signpost for metabolic syndrome. To make a long story short, diets rich in sugar and saturated fats contribute to cardiovascular disease because they promote high levels of plaque-forming LDLs. Conversely, physical activity helps prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering triglycerides, raising HDL levels, and to a lesser degree lowering LDL.

All mammalian species spend some fraction of their sleep time in REM, and that fraction steadily decreases as they get older.47 In humans, infants spend half of their sleeping time in REM, adults spend only 10–20 percent of sleep in REM, and the elderly spend even less. This cross-species trend is consistent with the fact that infants’ brains are so much more plastic (as we will see in chapter 9), and thus the competition for territory is even more critical. As an animal gets older, cortical takeovers become less possible. The falloff in plasticity parallels the falloff of time spent in REM sleep.

This precisely engineered timekeeper is called your circadian pacemaker, or biological clock. Specifically, it’s a group of nerves called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), in the hypothalamus, right above the pituitary gland. In the morning, sunlight comes into your eyeballs, travels along the optic nerve, and activates the SCN to begin each day’s circadian (Latin for “around a day”) rhythm. The SCN is the master clock that controls dozens of other clocks throughout your body. Over the course of the day, your core temperature, blood pressure, cognition, hormonal flow, alertness, energy, digestion, hunger, metabolism, creativity, sociability, and athleticism, and your ability to heal, memorize, and sleep, among many other functions, fluctuate according to and are governed by the commands of your inner clocks.

Gastrin stimulates the muscle contractions of the intestines that move waste through the alimentary canal. Cholecystokinin signals the gall bladder and pancreas to release enzymes and bile to break down food fat and protein in the gut.

Caffeine is the most abused substance on the planet, and, despite our being conditioned to associate morning grog with a morning joe, coffee does not combat sleep inertia. Although caffeine is a stimulant, and it will make you jittery, it does not actually make you more awake. In fact, it only makes you less sleepy. Adenosine is a substance in our brains that makes us feel sleepy. Caffeine is an adenosine receptor inhibitor, effectively putting the brakes on sleepiness. This mechanism can be a wonderful thing at 2:00 p.m. Adenosine, a by-product of cellular metabolism, gradually builds up over the course of the day. But upon waking, thanks to your inner clock, you don’t have adenosine in your system. Drinking coffee in the morning is like throwing water on an already extinguished fire. Coffee does give you a hit of adrenaline, which is why people equate it with feeling energized. The problem is, caffeine tolerance builds up over time, and you need to increase the amount of intake to get the effect, just as with any other addicting drug.

Although it might work to make you fall asleep (or, if you drink enough, pass out), your sleep will be of inferior quality. An alcohol-addled brain gets stuck in Stage 3 and Stage 4 deep delta wave sleep and doesn’t cross into REM sleep, which is when mental restoration and memory consolidation occur.

Sleep experts have long known about the importance of avoiding the “supine” sleep position—lying flat on your back. In this position, gravity contributes to the collapse of the airway. Almost everyone, whether they have a sleep disorder or not, is more susceptible to airway collapse and deeper oxygen desaturation when they sleep on their backs. People who don’t have sleep apnea will simply snore more when they’re on their backs, while those with sleep apnea are more likely to stop breathing in this position.

How do you know if you could have sleep apnea? One of the most common symptoms is snoring. Snoring is a sign that your airway is collapsing somewhat during sleep and your airflow is being limited when you try to inhale. If you snore really loudly, you have an increased risk for sleep apnea. If your spouse or other bed partner notices that you appear to stop breathing during sleep, that’s an even bigger risk factor. But most important, if you are sleepy during the daytime, meaning that you’re not just tired but actually fall asleep when you don’t intend to, such as when you’re watching TV or reading a boring book, you’re at even greater risk.

your body produces harmful free radicals in response to the oxygen-rich environment generated by increased respiration during aerobic training. These free radicals create oxidative stress, meaning that they overwhelm the number of antioxidants in your body that can counteract their damage. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to the aging process, and it is well established that excessive aerobic exercise can cause oxidative stress.

Leadership is a quality rather than a job. We are all leaders and followers at different points in our lives. Many aspects of this book should be useful to those looking to grow as leaders as well as managers, and great managers should cultivate leadership not just in themselves but also within their teams. This is an important distinction because while the role of a manager can be given to someone (or taken away), leadership is not something that can be bestowed. It must be earned. People must want to follow you. You can be someone’s manager, but if that person does not trust or respect you, you will have limited ability to influence him.

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.

Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.

I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said, “I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.” So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him. Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.

The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says “No” and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism glandular, nervous, muscular gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward – moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.
