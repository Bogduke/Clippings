You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at www. publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm, or in a low-cost mutual fund like Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities or Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Fund.13 Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal substitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run, so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors, allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelligent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe—and entirely beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.

It is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly hold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may involve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible missing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better for the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to put in stocks, except when the general market level is much higher than can be justified by well-established standards of value.

But investing isn’t about beating others at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game. The challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks that will go up the most and down the least, but rather to prevent yourself from being your own worst enemy—from buying high just because Mr. Market says “Buy!” and from selling low just because Mr. Market says “Sell!”

In that case, instead of making a total stock market index fund your complete portfolio, make it the foundation of your portfolio.

The Black Swan (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)

it does not pay to shoot for one large win. Mother Nature destined us to derive enjoyment from a steady flow of pleasant small, but frequent, rewards. As I said, the rewards do not have to be large, just frequent—a little bit here, a little bit there. Consider that our major satisfaction for thousands of years came in the form of food and water (and something else more private), and that while we need these steadily, we quickly reach saturation.
==========
The Black Swan (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)

Humans will believe anything you say provided you do not exhibit the smallest shadow of diffidence; like animals, they can detect the smallest crack in your confidence before you express it. The trick is to be as smooth as possible in personal manners. It is much easier to signal self-confidence if you are exceedingly polite and friendly; you can control people without having to offend their sensitivity. The problem with business people, Nero realized, is that if you act like a loser they will treat you as a loser—you set the yardstick yourself. There is no absolute measure of good or bad. It is not what you are telling people, it is how you are saying it.

The Black Swan (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)

We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our successes to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good stuff, but not for the bad. This causes us to think that we are better than others at whatever we do for a living.

You would rather own a business that earns a high return on capital than one that earns a low return on capital!
==========
The Little Book That Beats the Market (Joel Greenblatt)

if you just stick to buying good companies (ones that have a high return on capital) and to buying those companies only at bargain prices (at prices that give you a high earnings yield), you can end up systematically buying many of the good companies that crazy Mr. Market has decided to literally give away.
==========
The Little Book That Beats the Market (Joel Greenblatt)

For earnings yield, the formula looks for companies that earn a lot compared to the price we have to pay. For return on capital, the formula looks for companies that earn a lot compared to how much the company has to pay to buy the assets that created those earnings. To calculate these ratios, the magic formula doesn’t look at future earnings. That’s too hard. The magic formula uses last year’s earnings.

For those stocks with a gain, we will want to sell a day or two after the one-year period is up. In that way, all of our gains will receive the advantages of the lower tax rate afforded to long-term capital gains (a maximum 15 percent tax rate under federal guidelines for stocks held more than one year), and all of our losses will receive short-term tax treat-ment (a deduction against other sources of income that otherwise could have been taxable at rates up to 35 percent). Over time, this minor adjustment can add significantly to our after-tax investment returns.

==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

how do we measure return on capital? The three most common ways are return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return on invested capital (ROIC). Each gives us the same information, but in a slightly different way.
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

Return on assets (ROA) measures how much income a company generates per dollar of assets,
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

Very broadly speaking, a nonfinancial company that can consistently generate an ROA of 7 percent or so likely has some kind of competitive advantage over its peers.
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

ROE measures the efficiency with which a company uses shareholders’ equity—think of it as measuring profits per dollar of shareholders’ capital. One flaw of ROE is that companies can take on a lot of debt and boost their ROE without becoming more profitable, so it’s a good idea to look at ROE alongside how much debt a company has.

Like ROA, you can find ROE calculated for most companies on just about any financial web site.

Finally, there’s return on invested capital (ROIC), which combines the best of both worlds. It measures the return on all capital invested in the firm, regardless of whether it is equity or debt. So, it incorporates debt—unlike ROA—but removes the distortion that can make highly leveraged companies look very profitable using ROE. It also uses a different definition of profits that helps remove any effects caused by a company’s financing decisions (debt versus equity), so we can get as close as possible to a number that represents the true efficiency of the underlying business.

==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

To see if a company has an economic moat, first check its historical track record of generating returns on capital. Strong returns indicate that the company may have a moat, while poor returns point to a lack of competitive advantage—unless the company’s business has changed substantially.
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

If historical returns on capital are strong, ask yourself how the company will maintain them.
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

Always remember the four drivers of valuation: risk, return on capital, competitive advantage, and growth. All else being equal, you should pay less for riskier stocks, more for companies with high returns on capital, more for companies with strong competitive advantages, and more for companies with higher growth prospects. Bear in mind that these drivers compound each other.

Use multiple tools. If one ratio or metric indicates that the company is cheap, apply another as well. The stars won’t always align, but when they do, it’s a good indication that you’ve found a truly undervalued company.

The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

The price-to-sales ratio is most useful for companies that are temporarily unprofitable or are posting lower profit margins than they could. If a company with the potential for better margins has a very low price-to-sales ratio, you might have a cheap stock in your sights.
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

The price-to-book ratio is most useful for financial services firms, because the book value of these companies more closely reflects the actual tangible value of their business. Be wary of extremely low price-to-book ratios, because they can indicate that the book value may be questionable.
==========
The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

Ask yourself these questions the next time you think about selling, and if you can’t answer yes to one or more, don’t sell. • Did I make a mistake? • Has the company changed for the worse? • Is there a better place for my money? • Has the stock become too large a portion of my portfolio?

The Little Book That Builds Wealth: The Knockout Formula for Finding Great Investments (Pat Dorsey)

The best investors are always looking for the best places for their money. Selling a modestly undervalued stock to fund the purchase of a supercheap stock is a smart strategy.

you get the most “bang for the buck” by about a five-year maturity. This is the steepest part of the yield curve— the part that rewards you the most. Beyond that, the extra return diminishes, with continually increasing risk. The stock portion of your portfolio is the place to take risk, not the bond portion, where the purpose is to shelter you from market downturns and provide ready liq- uidity. The curve is steepest in the first year or two. For the most part, then, you should keep the maturity of your bond portfolio between one and five years. There are a wide variety of bond funds that will accomplish this.

The Divide: Global Inequality From Conquest to Free Markets (Jason Hickel)

We are told that poverty is a natural phenomenon that can be fixed with aid. But in reality it is a political problem: poverty doesn’t just exist, it has been created. Poor countries are poor because they are integrated into the global economic system on unequal terms. Aid only works to hide the deep patterns of wealth extraction that cause poverty and inequality in the first place: rigged trade deals, tax evasion, land grabs and the costs associated with climate change.

For the first time, global South countries were free to determine their own economic policies. And seeing how well Keynesian economics was working in Europe and the United States, they were quick to adopt its basic principles: state-led development, plenty of social spending and decent wages for workers. And they added one crucial piece to the Keynesian consensus: a desire to build their economies for their own national good, rather than solely for the benefit of external powers.

The Divide: Global Inequality From Conquest to Free Markets (Jason Hickel)

The solution to mass poverty turns out to be remarkably simple. Poor people don’t need charity, they need fair wages for their work, labour unions to defend those wages and state regulation that prevents exploitation. They need decent public services – such as universal healthcare and education – and a progressive taxation system capable of funding them. They need fair access to land and a fair share of natural resource wealth. In other words, real development requires the redistribution of power, which then in most cases naturally precipitates a redistribution of resources.

Forcing governments to repay their debts at exorbitant interest rates – and forcing them to take out new loans in order to cover the old ones – meant that many countries ended up spending large proportions of their national budgets on debt service. Cutting spending on social services meant that hospitals and clinics fell apart, and investment in education fell to the point where it became impossible to produce the skills necessary for development. Cutting subsidies meant that farmers no longer had access to affordable inputs like seeds and equipment, that families spent increasing proportions of their income on food, and that infant industries no longer received the support they needed to become competitive on the global stage. Privatisation meant that key public services were run at a profit, which raised prices out of reach of the poor. Reducing trade tariffs meant that customs revenues collapsed, while foreign goods and competitors flooded in and undercut local producers, driving them out of business. Liberalising the financial sector meant that investors could pull their money out at the drop of a hat, which left finance dangerously unstable and unpredictable.

Between 1973 and 1993, global South debt grew from $100 billion to $1.5 trillion. Of the $1.5 trillion, only $400 billion was actually borrowed money. The rest was piled up simply as a result of compound interest. 52 So despite the monumental effort that developing countries make to repay their loans, they are only chipping away at an ever-growing mountain of compound interest and not even beginning to touch the principal that lies beneath, which threatens to persist for ever.

The hurried pace of modern life leaves a lot of people literally eating food on the run, which can cause malabsorption, robbing your body of vital nutrients. Inadequate chewing also puts an extra burden on your digestive tract, causing it to overproduce digestive juices in an attempt to break down the large food particles. This can cause gas, bloating, and, over time, more serious damage to your digestive system. So relax, slow down (and sit down!), savor your food, and chew thoroughly-you'll enjoy your food more and you'll be doing your digestive tract a favor.

Insulin is the hormone that moves glucose or sugar from the bloodstream into the cells. At optimal levels, insulin is your friend, functioning as an anabolic hormone to stimulate tissue growth. Unfortunately, in excess, it becomes your enemy. Excessive insulin can lead to a "spare tire" of unsightly and unhealthy body fat around the waistline. Too much insulin raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and hinders the work of your hormones of youth. Extra insulin also stimulates production of cortisol, which stimulates production of more insulin, thereby creating a vicious cycle. Excessive insulin, which is a consequence of high-sugar and high-glycemic-food diets so common today, does more to accelerate the aging process than just about any other contributor.

All cancers, however, are characterized by the uncontrolled replication of cells. Normal cells reproduce only as needed, such as to build new tissues in a growing child and to replace cells that have gotten sickly or have died. Cancerous cells, on the other hand, are linked to DNA (genetic) mutations that cause them to divide continuously, creating a continually growing number of new cancerous cells. Unstopped, these cells can damage or starve the affected organ or system. Cancerous cells also sometimes spread (metastasize) from the original site in the body to cause cancerous cells to form in other distant organs or systems. It is this process that accounts for the majority of the deaths from cancer. Your risk of contracting cancer is determined to some extent by your genes, as evidenced by certain cancers, such as breast cancer, that seem to run in families. However, the principal cause of the DNA mutations that trigger such uncontrolled cell growth is exposure to free radicals. These are unstable molecules that steal electrons from other molecules in your body, including your DNA molecules. This can seriously damage the attacked molecule, sometimes causing mutations that lead to cancer.

Your body requires a constant supply of these amino acid building blocks to live. And while your body can produce its own supply of many amino acids, eight are known as essential amino acids because you must obtain them from your food. Consuming complete protein from sources such as meat, milk, and other animal products provides you with all eight essential amino acids. But you don't need to consume complete proteins as long as you eat all eight essential amino acids over the course of each day, not necessarily at every meal.

Soybeans are a particularly good protein source, being the only complete vegetable protein containing all eight essential amino acids. Soy also contains valuable vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and fiber. In addition to traditional foods, such as tofu, soy protein can now be found in a wide range of products, including soy milk, soy burgers, and soy pastas. A number of health benefits have also been attributed to consumption of soy products, such as a slight lowering of cholesterol levels. Soy may also be beneficial in helping prevent cardiovascular disease, some hormonally sensitive cancers, and menopausal osteoporosis. Yet, moderation must also be applied to soy.

Processing whole-wheat flour into white flour or brown rice into white rice removes the fiber and bran. This turns healthy carbohydrates into unhealthy ones that promote inflammation. Fiber and bran fill you up before you get too many calories. Also, they slow the rate of absorption from your gut into your blood, so your blood sugar rises slowly and not too high. When fiber and bran are removed, your food gets rapidly absorbed, causing your blood sugar to spike to high levels, which in turn causes your pancreas to secrete insulin to bring your blood sugar back down. After a while, it’s as if these repeated surges of insulin cause your insulin receptors to say, “Oh, no, not more insulin!” so they downregulate and become less sensitive. Because of this, your body needs to make more and more insulin to lower your blood sugar an equivalent amount. This is called insulin resistance.

When you eat and digest food, the electrons stored in its fat, protein, and carbohydrates are converted by a part of your cells called mitochondria to provide energy for you. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells. Here, the electrons are combined with oxygen in your blood to make its energy available to you. These electrons travel in pairs, which keeps them stable. Unfortunately, this process is not perfect. Sometimes, one of these electrons becomes isolated from the other one and becomes what is called a free radical (not to be confused with Patty Hearst in her early days…). These are unstable molecules that need another electron to become stable and will do just about anything to get it, regardless of how much damage is done in the process. It appears that even electrons don’t like to be lonely! When unstable molecules “steal” electrons from other molecules throughout your body in order to stabilize themselves, this is called oxidation. This creates instability in these molecules and damages these cells in a process called oxidative stress.

In a good carb, the fiber and bran fill you up before you get too many calories. For example, you can only eat so many apples—you’ll get full before you eat too much. Also, fiber and bran slow the rate at which you absorb nutrients (including sugar) from your gut into your bloodstream. In contrast, you can consume large amounts of sugar, white rice, and white flour without getting full because you’ve removed the fiber and bran. Also, the food gets absorbed very quickly—it’s like injecting sugar into your veins—causing your blood sugar to spike. This, in turn, causes your pancreas to make more insulin. As we’ve discussed in Chapter 2, insulin creates chronic inflammation, one of the underlying mechanisms of most chronic diseases. And the repeated surges of insulin lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

Stretching helps keep you flexible and avoid injury. Your mind affects your body: when you’re stressed, the muscles in your body tense and contract to protect your inner organs during times of danger

Choose a weight that allows you to do no fewer than eight and no more than fifteen repetitions per set. Do fewer reps with more weight to gain muscle size and strength; do more reps with less weight to gain muscle endurance. In either case, choose a weight that barely allows you to finish the last rep, as that’s where the beneficial effects are the greatest.

one of the easiest and quickest ways to control stress is to consciously breathe slowly and deeply. The practice of consciously guiding the direction, depth, and rhythm of your breath can restore, calm, and balance the nervous system, increase oxygen circulation in the blood, help increase awareness of internal states, and lower blood pressure and heart rate.

Meditation is the act of steadying your concentration on one object, such as your breath, a word, or a feeling. Meditation allows us to stay centered while we observe the natural ups and downs of the mind. The benefits of meditation also include better concentration, a more consistent feeling of calm, clarity, and a sharpened mind.

Just as our mind affects our body, our body affects our mind. So when you stretch chronically tensed muscles slowly and gently, you allow the body and mind to relax.

Undo It! (Dean Ornish, M.D.;Anne Ornish)

Reminders for Gentle Stretching   Move slowly and consciously, and never strain. Pay attention to the area being stretched. Stretch to a point before you feel pain, not beyond. Always keep your breath natural and through the nose whenever possible. Always remember to breathe smoothly and evenly during stretching postures. Full-body inhalations and exhalations help you to relax and stretch farther. The time you take for relaxing between the poses is as important as the postures themselves. Be aware of signs of stress—dizziness, shortness of breath, pain, and agitation. Use common sense. If it hurts, stop what you are doing. Hold each posture only as long as it feels comfortable. The goal is to feel peaceful and relaxed.

Undo It! (Dean Ornish, M.D.;Anne Ornish)

One of the easiest and quickest ways to reduce stress is with your breath. The breath anchors us in the present moment while serving as a bridge between body and mind. After all, changes in your mind both affect and reflect your breathing.
==========
Undo It! (Dean Ornish, M.D.;Anne Ornish)

In meditation, you gently focus without forcing or trying. Stay open to all of your surroundings, and to the deepest parts of your inner experience. Your mind will rest on the object of your meditation (such as a word, a prayer, or the breath), and when it wanders away from that object, as it will—and this will happen most of the time when you’re beginning—the objective is to simply observe where it goes and, without any labels or judgments, gently return to your point of focus. The idea here is that you aren’t engaged in the process of thinking but rather are cultivating an attitude of “witnessing.” Notice what is arising and gently let it pass.

Undo It! (Dean Ornish, M.D.;Anne Ornish)

Processing whole-wheat flour into white flour or brown rice into white rice removes the fiber and bran. This turns healthy carbohydrates into unhealthy ones that promote inflammation. Fiber and bran fill you up before you get too many calories. Also, they slow the rate of absorption from your gut into your blood, so your blood sugar rises slowly and not too high. When fiber and bran are removed, your food gets rapidly absorbed, causing your blood sugar to spike to high levels, which in turn causes your pancreas to secrete insulin to bring your blood sugar back down. After a while, it’s as if these repeated surges of insulin cause your insulin receptors to say, “Oh, no, not more insulin!” so they downregulate and become less sensitive. Because of this, your body needs to make more and more insulin to lower your blood sugar an equivalent amount. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance also causes inflammation by increasing secretion of what are called cytokines from immune function cells. A vicious cycle results in which more insulin causes more inflammation, which causes more insulin resistance, often leading to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

But there is an easier way to manage the Chimp’s emotional reaction to any situation, which doesn’t involve the Human. As we have seen, the Computer thinks at twenty times the speed of the Human and four times the speed of the Chimp. Consequently, if we can get the Computer to act before the Chimp thinks then we will avoid the battle between the Human and the Chimp. In order to do this you need to have thought through what situations might happen and have a response programmed into the Computer ready to act.

Food processing began as a way to extend the shelf life of food by protecting it from these competitors.

The more processed a food is, the longer the shelf life, and the less nutritious it typically is. Real food is alive - and therefore it should eventually die.

With the result that today corn contributes 554 calories a day to America’s per capita food supply and soy another 257. Add wheat (768 calories) and rice (91) and you can see there isn’t a whole lot of room left in the American stomach for any other foods. Today these four crops account for two thirds of the calories we eat. When you consider that humankind has historical y consumed some eighty thousand edible species, and that three thousand of these have been in widespread use, this represents a radical simplification of the human diet. Why should this concern us? Because humans are omnivores, requiring somewhere between fifty and a hundred different chemical compounds and elements in order to be healthy.

We spend too much time trying to be “good” when good is often merely average. To be great we must be different.

Modern positive psychology research has shown again and again that one of the keys to happiness is emphasizing what are called “signature strengths.” Research by Gallup shows that the more hours per day you spend doing what you’re good at, the less stressed you feel and the more you laugh, smile, and feel you’re being treated with respect. Once you know what type of person you are and your signature strengths, how do you thrive? This leads to Mukunda’s second piece of advice: pick the right pond.

After your food is broken down by enzymes in the intestine, the fat and most other nutrients get absorbed into intestinal cells (called enterocytes). Here, fat and fat-soluble nutrients are prepared for circulation through the bloodstream. You can eat all the fat and cholesterol you want, and none of it will get into your arteries without first being wrapped inside a special layer of protein. When they’re working as designed, the special proteins suspend all the fats inside them in the solution of our bloodstream, and this is what prevents dietary fat from clogging our arteries. The resulting little blobs of fat wrapped in protein are called lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are designed rather like microscopic M&Ms. Just as the candy’s coating prevents the chocolate inside it from getting all over your hands, the protein coat enables lipoproteins to circulate throughout your body without getting their messy insides smeared on your arterial walls.

The story of a heart attack, illustrated here, begins with degraded lipoproteins dropping out of circulation, landing on the lining of your blood vessels, where they attract a cleanup crew of white blood cells.

Oxidation reactions are ongoing in our bodies all the time. We breathe oxygen because, thanks to mitochondrial enzymes, we can harness the power of oxygen to turn fat and sugar into chemical energy with a high degree of efficiency. But nothing in this universe is 100 percent efficient. So sometimes oxygen goes about its business in our bodies without enzymatic supervision, generating random reactions that our bodies do not want. It’s these random oxidation reactions that rust and rot us slowly from the inside out, playing a primary role in the natural aging of the body. Wrinkles, stiffness, presbyopia (the loss of near vision resulting from a stiffening of the lens of the eye)—all the drawbacks of getting older—come at least in part from the accumulated damage of decades of oxidation reactions.

Glycation: The Reason Sugar Is Bad for You Ever notice how licked lollipops and half-chewed taffy have a tacky feeling? Sugar feels sticky because, once dissolved in water, it reacts with proteins on the surface of your skin to form easily breakable chemical bonds. When you pull your fingers apart and feel that sticky resistance, you’re feeling the tug of those bonds being broken. The process by which sugar sticks to stuff is called glycation. Glycation reactions are reversible, but with enough heat or time, the temporary bonds become permanent due to oxidation reactions. The products of these later oxidation reactions are called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs. And that’s a useful acronym, because AGEs make you age unnaturally fast. When you toast bread, oxidation reactions generate AGEs in the proteins and sugars present in wheat. These AGEs change the bread from soft, pliable, and pale, to hard, stiff, and brown because the proteins and sugars form cross-links that stiffen the bread. The same thing happens inside your body as AGEs cross-link normally mobile proteins. This hardens your cells and tissues, making them brittle and stiff. Fortunately, at normal blood sugar levels, the reactions occur so slowly that cleanup crews of white blood cells keep them under control by breaking them down. The kidney cleans these AGEs from the blood and excretes them from the body. It is principally these waste chemicals that give urine its characteristic yellow color.

Studies show that a mere one percent of the retinoids (vitamin A precursors) in raw carrots, for instance, get absorbed. 503 But cooking (which hydrolyzes cellulose in much the same way it hydrolyzes proteins) increases that percentage to 30

Lactose is the major type of sugar in milk. Nearly everyone can digest it while we’re babies and dependent on our mother’s milk, but many people lose the lactase enzyme in the lining of the intestine, growing lactose intolerant as they get older. Fermentation breaks down lactose, so you don’t need that enzyme as long as you only eat fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese.

To successfully avoid eating oxidized fats, you must avoid all foods containing vegetable oils. As I described in Chapter 7, vegetable oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, which are particularly prone to oxidation and readily deform into the collection of distorted fatty acids I call MegaTrans. And, as explained in Chapter 7, saturated fat resists oxidation—so much so that, in the body, it can help check inflammation before it gets too far out of control. Eating foods like butter, cream, and coconut oil can protect against some of the worst effects of oxidation and can actually help you lose weight.

One reason diets fail is that cutting back on calories without changing any other habits sends precisely the wrong message. The body presumes that the meager food intake, in combination with little activity, must mean food has become so scarce that you’ve given up looking for more. If it has the slightest chance to store surplus energy as fat, the panicked body reasons it had better do so. Under these circumstances, stem cells stand at the ready to convert themselves into more energy-storing fat cells. Frightening our stem cells into turning into fat cells is exactly the wrong thing to do.

metabolism of sugar to energy occurs in two stages. The first stage, called glycolysis, doesn’t require oxygen and is therefore an anaerobic process. It produces the starting material (pyruvic acid) for the second stage, along with some energy for your cells, called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The second stage uses oxygen to burn the products of the first reaction, and is therefore an aerobic process. The aerobic stage of sugar metabolism produces lots and lots of ATP. If the muscles don’t get enough oxygen to burn all that pyruvic acid, the acids start building up and you feel the burn, telling you your muscles are about to fail. And that’s a useful signal. If you were being chased by a lion, for example, the burning signal would warn you that your muscles were on the verge of seizing up. Time to start looking for a tree!Once the anaerobic activity is over, your metabolic management team furiously takes notes on the physiologic event that just took place, taking record of which muscles worked the hardest and will need to be tweaked for better performance in the future.

The plant starts out with low-energy electrons and, using the energy of the sun, charges them up into high-energy electrons. In this way, plants store the sun’s energy. When you then eat the plant (or the animals who ate the plant), these electrons (in the form of carbohydrates, protein, and fat) are delivered to all your cells. Then your mitochondria take the plant’s power-packed electrons and use them as an energy source—that is, as fuel—and slowly release their energy. Mind you, this process has to occur in a precise, tightly controlled manner, because these electrons are packed with energy and are therefore volatile, like gasoline.

You can slow down this oxidant process by eating foods containing lots of antioxidants. You can tell whether a food is rich in antioxidants by slicing it open, exposing it to air (oxygen), and then seeing what happens. If it turns brown, it’s oxidizing. Think about our two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn brown quickly, which means there aren’t a lot of antioxidants inside them. (Most of the antioxidants in apples are in the peels.) Cut open a mango and what happens? Nothing happens, because there are lots of antioxidants in there. How do you keep fruit salad from turning brown? By adding lemon juice, which contains the antioxidant vitamin C.

Think of insulin as the key that unlocks the doors to your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time you eat a meal, insulin is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the glucose into your cells.

During REM sleep, cortisol is suppressed, and your metabolic rate increases. When you don’t sleep well, you get less REM in the second half of the night, and that results in higher levels of cortisol and insulin, which stimulate appetite and lead to greater insulin resistance. In plain terms, this means that a bad night of sleep can throw you into a temporary prediabetic state.

Here’s how type 2 diabetes develops: in a healthy person, the digestive system breaks food down into glucose. The beta cells in the pancreas make a hormone, insulin, which is released into the bloodstream and allows glucose to enter the body’s cells to be used as fuel. In a wonderfully tidy system, insulin binds to receptors on the cells, like a key fitting into a lock. The lock turns, the door opens, and glucose can enter the body’s cells. But too much belly or liver fat can cause your body to become insulin resistant, meaning that cells don’t respond to insulin the way they should. Their “locks” —the insulin receptors—gum up and stick; the key no longer fits as well. It’s harder for glucose to enter the cells. The glucose that can’t get in through the door remains in the bloodstream. Glucose builds up in the blood even as your pancreas churns out more and more insulin.

This idea—that improving your metabolic health is more important than losing weight—is vital, and that’s because repeated dieting takes a toll on your body. There are some internal “push back” mechanisms that makes it hard for us to keep weight off. Our body has a set point that it defends, and when we lose weight, we also slow our metabolism in an effort to regain the weight (“metabolic adaptation”).

Other anti-inflammatory foods include oily fish, nuts, flaxseed, flax oil, and leafy vegetables—because all these items are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.

But if you pump up the cells’ medium (the liquid soup that supports a cell’s life when it’s sitting in a lab flask) with vitamin C, the telomere is protected from the free radicals.13 Vitamin C and other antioxidants (like vitamin E) are scavengers that gobble up free radicals, preventing them from harming your telomeres and cells.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the intestines and occurs when gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, is ingested. When a person with Celiac disease consumes gluten, the protein is not broken down through the normal digestion process. It’s viewed as an enemy and is attacked by the immune system. Over time, the consumption of gluten damages the small intestine, specifically villi, the small fingerlike projections that assist in nutrient absorption. Damaged villi within the intestines will lead to less nutrient absorption and potential malnutrition.

Carbohydrates provide energy for your body, which is why the bulk of the calories in your diet should come from carbs. Every cell in your body can use the simple sugar molecule–glucose derived from carbohydrates.
==========
Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

Carbohydrates get broken down in the body to their simplest forms, a one-sugar molecule called glucose. Glucose is the preferred source of energy for your body, brain, and red blood cells. Your body can also store glucose, but first must transform it to what is called glycogen. About a third of glycogen resides in the liver. The liver also coverts the glycogen to glucose and releases it into the blood. Muscle tissue contains glycogen stores, too, which is what gives an athlete an extra burst of energy.

Proteins are large molecules made up of strands of amino acids linked together. Variations of proteins are made depending on the order of amino acids. This order is predetermined by the genetic code in the DNA. Proteins don’t live forever; their lifespan varies from a few minutes to a few years. Eventually they need to be replicated.
==========
Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

Inside the center or nucleus of each cell is a system set up like a tiny factory line whose job is to replicate DNA. This system can read the genetic information from DNA, then use this information to make an exact copy of the DNA in the form of messenger RNA. The messenger RNA (mRNA) carries all the instructions needed for making new proteins. Once formed, the mRNA leaves the center of the cell and moves to the outer part of the cell, called the cytoplasm. Located in the cytoplasm is another tiny factory system called ribosome whose job is to get all the instructions from the mRNA to make new proteins. Transfer RNA (tRNA) then gathers amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then uses the amino acids (from the tRNA) and instructions (from the mRNA) to make new proteins. These new proteins exactly match the specifications dictated by the mRNA. This new protein then is released from the ribosome and travels to its predetermined workplace.

Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

There are 9 essential amino acids and 11 nonessential amino acids. They’re categorized as such because essential amino acids must be obtained from food due to the fact that the body doesn’t have the capacity to make them. Nonessential amino acids can be made from other amino acids.

To break down the fat, bile is released from the gallbladder into the digestive tract. The bile salts in the bile emulsify the fat. Emulsification refers to breaking the large fat clusters of molecules into smaller ones. When the fat is in smaller particles, it’s easier for pancreatic lipase, the fat-digesting enzyme, to break it down for digestion.
==========
Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

A saturated fat is a type of fat that is solid at room temperature. “Saturated” refers to its chemical structure being made up of fatty acids heavily laden with hydrogen atoms, which allows for no double bonds between carbon molecules. The hydrogen atoms make the long fatty acid chain more stable because it’s difficult for other molecules to knock off a hydrogen atom and cause oxidation. Oxidation makes the fat go rancid.
==========
Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

To make trans fats in the lab, liquid oil is heated under pressure and exposed to hydrogen gas and a catalyst. This process is called hydrogenation. The oil is now transformed into a solid and can be used many times without spoilage. It also makes processed foods that contain it less likely to spoil and increases their flavor stability. That’s why processed foods contain trans fat. Oil is a very expensive ingredient, and it makes sense why food manufacturers and the restaurant industry would benefit from its use.

As high levels of LDL circulate through your vessels, some of the LDL becomes oxidized by free radicals. Oxidized LDL encourages the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the inner lining of an artery, which attracts white blood cells and promotes their bonding to the damaged area. The site then becomes laden with more cholesterol and lipids, which continues to increase the thickness of the buildup we call plaque.

Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

Vitamin C helps make collagen, which is a fibrous protein used in building bones and teeth. It also helps strengthen veins and capillary walls, along with aiding in wound repair. It supports collagen formation by protecting iron molecules from being oxidized during the formation of collagen. Without vitamin C’s action, no protein would be formed and tissue repair, such as in the formation of scars, would never occur.
==========
Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

The tolerable upper intake limit for Vitamin C for adults is 200mg per day. If you overconsume vitamin C, it can lead to headache, nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps, fatigue, and hot flashes. However, you would have to take an excess of over 4,000 mg per day.
==========
Optimum Nutrition (Idiot's Guides) (Green, Stephanie)

Because these vitamins are fat-soluble, they must be emulsified by bile before your body can absorb them. Additionally, many need a protein carrier to travel through the bloodstream. Unlike water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the liver and fatty body tissues, which allows your body to release the vitamins on demand. It also means you don’t necessarily need to eat foods containing that particular vitamin every day because your body can store it. Unfortunately, with A, D and E, you can reach toxic levels that can be detrimental to your health.

Our minds automatically equate ‘I have X’ with ‘I deserve X’. When our eyes fall on those who lack the bare necessities, we immediately sympathize and express outrage that they do not have enough, but we do not for a moment allow ourselves to think that their deprivation may be the product of the same process that led to our affluence. This is the psychological mechanism that convinces the haves and those in power (who are usually the same people) that it is right, proper and necessary for them to have more while others have much less.

System 1 is not prone to doubt. It suppresses ambiguity and spontaneously constructs stories that are as coherent as possible. Unless the message is immediately negated, the associations that it evokes wil spread as if the message were true. System 2 is capable of doubt, because it can maintain incompatible possibilities at the same time. However, sustaining doubt is harder work than sliding into certainty.

We are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities (such as a sequence of six girls) appear not by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone’s intention. We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that the process is truly random.

The phenomenon we were studying is so common and so important in the everyday world that you should know its name: it is an anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered—hence the image of an anchor. If you are asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died you wil end up with a much higher estimate of his age at death than you would if the anchoring question referred to death at 35.

Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

Directness is the practice of learning by directly doing the thing you want to learn. Basically, it’s improvement through active practice rather than through passive learning. The phrases learning something new and practicing something new may seem similar, but these two methods can produce profoundly different results. Passive learning creates knowledge. Active practice creates skill.

Transfer has been called the “Holy Grail of education.” It happens when you learn something in one context, say in a classroom, and are able to use it in another context, say in real life.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

When we learn new things, therefore, we should always strive to tie them directly to the contexts we want to use them in. Building knowledge outward from the kernel of a real situation is much better than the traditional strategy of learning something and hoping that we’ll be able to shift it into a real context at some undetermined future time.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

Many ultralearners opt for projects rather than classes to learn the skills they need. The rationale is simple: if you organize your learning around producing something, you’re guaranteed to at least learn how to produce that thing. If you take classes, you may spend a lot of time taking notes and reading but not achieve your goal.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

Immersion is the process of surrounding yourself with the target environment in which the skill is practiced. This has the advantage of requiring much larger amounts of practice than would be typical, as well as exposing you to a fuller range of situations in which the skill applies. Learning a language is the canonical example of where immersion works. By immersing yourself in an environment where a language is spoken, not only do you guarantee that you’ll end up practicing the language a lot more than you would otherwise (since you have no choice), but you also face a broader diversity of situations that require learning new words and phrases.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

The overkill approach is to put yourself into an environment where the demands are going to be extremely high, so you’re unlikely to miss any important lessons or feedback.

Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

Minutes after studying something using a strategy of passive review, students perform better than they would if they had practiced retrieval.3 The feeling that you’re learning more when you’re reading rather than trying to recall with a closed book isn’t inaccurate. The problem comes after. Test again days later, and retrieval practice beats passive review by a mile.

Especially if you combine retrieval with the ability to look up the answers, retrieval practice is a much better form of studying than the ones most students apply.

Ultralearners need to be sensitive to what feedback is actually useful and tune out the rest.

Not only can overly negative feedback lower your motivation, but so can overly positive feedback. Ultralearners must balance both concerns, pushing for the right level of feedback for their current stage of learning.

Ultralearners acquire skills quickly because they seek aggressive feedback when others opt for practice that includes weaker forms of feedback or no feedback at all.

One of the pieces of studying advice that is best supported by research is that if you care about long-term retention, don’t cram. Spreading learning sessions over more intervals over longer periods of time tends to cause somewhat lower performance in the short run (because there is a chance for forgetting between intervals) but much better performance in the long run.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

If you have ten hours to learn something, therefore, it makes more sense to spend ten days studying one hour each than to spend ten hours studying in one burst. Obviously, however, if the amount of time between study intervals gets longer and longer, the short-term effects start to outweigh the long-term ones.

Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

This has led many ultralearners to apply what are known as spaced-repetition systems (SRS) as a tool for trying to retain the most knowledge with the least effort.

The second disadvantage is that recalling from mnemonics is often not as automatic as directly remembering something. Knowing a mnemonic for a foreign-language word is better than failing to remember it entirely, but it’s still too slow to allow you to fluently form sentences out of mnemonically remembered words. Thus mnemonics can act as a bridge for difficult-to-remember information, but it’s usually not the final step in creating memories that will endure forever.

==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

However, as your skill develops, it’s often no longer enough to simply follow the examples of others; you need to experiment and find your own path. Part of the reason for this is that the early part of learning a skill tends to be the best trodden and supported, as everyone begins at the same place. As your skills develop, however, not only are there fewer people who can teach you and fewer students you could have as peers (thus lowering the total market for books, classes, and instructors), but you also start to diverge from those you’re learning from.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

I see the experimental mindset as an extension of the growth mindset: whereas the growth mindset encourages you to see opportunities and potential for improvement, experimentation enacts a plan to reach those improvements.

Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

The traditional path to mastery is to take a well-defined skill and practice it relentlessly until you have become insanely good at it.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

However, for many areas of creative or professional skills, another, more accessible, path is to combine two skills that don’t necessarily overlap to bring about a distinct advantage that those who specialize in only one of those skills do not have. For instance, you might be an engineer who becomes really good at public speaking. You may not be the best possible engineer or the best possible presenter, but combining those two skills could make you the best person to present on engineering topics for your company at conferences, thus giving you access to new professional opportunities.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

This suggests that for many skills, the best option is going to be extreme in some way, since so many more of the possibilities are themselves extreme. Sticking to the middle and playing it safe isn’t the correct approach because that allows you to explore only a small subset of the total possibilities for your work.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

I suggest starting with rather a narrow scope, which can expand as you proceed.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

Forgetting, as was discovered by Hermann Ebbinghaus more than a hundred years ago, falls off with an exponentially decaying curve. That means that memories that are retained for longer are less and less likely to be forgotten when you follow up at a later date. This pattern suggests that maintenance practice, too, can fall off on a decaying rate, so that the bulk of the knowledge you’ve acquired will be preserved.
==========
Ultralearning (Young, Scott)

I think pursuing aggressive ultralearning projects is often the surer way to enjoy learning more, as you’re more likely to reach a level where learning automatically becomes fun.

But our zeal doesn’t stop there. Scientists are now finding taste receptors that light up for sugar all the way down our esophagus to our stomach and pancreas, and they appear to be intricately tied to our appetites.

One, the sweet taste is their signal for foods that are rich in energy, and since kids are growing so fast, their bodies crave foods that provide quick fuel. Two, as humans, we didn’t evolve in an environment that had lots of intensely sweet foods, which probably heightens the excitement we feel when we eat sugar. And finally, sugar makes children feel good. “It’s an analgesic,” Mennella said. “It will reduce crying in a newborn baby.

In the world of processed foods, salt is the great fixer. It corrects myriad problems that arise as a matter of course in the factory. Cornflakes, for example, taste metallic without it.

The chip’s ingredients were likely just as effective, if not more so, in leading people to overeat. This starts with the coating of salt, which the tongue hits first, but there is much more inside the chip. They are loaded with fat, which gives them most of their calories. It also delivers the sensation called mouthfeel the moment they are chewed. As food scientists know, fat in the mouth is not like oil on the hand; it is a marvelous sensation, which the brain rewards with instant feelings of pleasure. There is still more: Potato chips are also loaded with sugar. Not the kind of sugar you will find on the label, though some chip makers do add sugar to their potato chips to meet the cravings of kids. No. The sugar in regular chips is the kind of sugar that the body gets from the starch in the potatoes. Starch is considered a carbohydrate, but more precisely, it is made of glucose, the same kind of glucose you have in your blood.

==========
You Can Negotiate Anything: The Groundbreaking Original Guide to Negotiation (Cohen, Herb)

Who’s the worst person you can negotiate for? Yourself. You do a much better job negotiating for someone else. Why? Because you take yourself too seriously in any interaction that concerns you. You care too much about yourself. That puts you under pressure and stress. When you negotiate for someone else, you’re more relaxed. You’re more objective. You don’t care as much, because you regard the situation as fun or as a game—which it is.

the human body generally operates in 90-minute cycles, whether awake or asleep. This pattern is called the “ultradian rhythm.” The start of each cycle is defined as a period of “arousal,” ramping up to a mid-period of high performance before finally decelerating in a period of “stress.” Understanding how the 90-minute rhythm cycle works in the context of the greater 24-hour rhythm—the “circadian rhythm”—can help us predict how we’ll function over the course of a day and how we can plan around it for peak performance.

==========
Super Learning: Advanced Strategies for Quicker Comprehension, Greater Retention, and Systematic Expertise (Science of Accelerated Learning 2.ed) (Learning how to Learn Book 14) (Hollins, Peter)

The first step is to preview. Don’t just dive in; rather, begin by trying to get a broad overview of what you’re doing, in what context, and why. See the big picture. What this looks like will depend on you and the subject you’re studying. For example, if you’re reading through an important chapter in a textbook, you might need to start with some skimming, i.e. read through the main headings and subheadings,
==========
Super Learning: Advanced Strategies for Quicker Comprehension, Greater Retention, and Systematic Expertise (Science of Accelerated Learning 2.ed) (Learning how to Learn Book 14) (Hollins, Peter)

The next step is to attend, i.e. pay attention. Crucially, the preview section helps you direct where your attention goes (that is, onto the most important concepts), but in the second step, you need to apply that attention fully.
==========
Super Learning: Advanced Strategies for Quicker Comprehension, Greater Retention, and Systematic Expertise (Science of Accelerated Learning 2.ed) (Learning how to Learn Book 14) (Hollins, Peter)

For step 3, we review. Just as we previewed, now we look again and see what ground we’ve covered, and what material has been absorbed. Just the act of revisiting what you’ve taken in reinforces it further.
==========
Super Learning: Advanced Strategies for Quicker Comprehension, Greater Retention, and Systematic Expertise (Science of Accelerated Learning 2.ed) (Learning how to Learn Book 14) (Hollins, Peter)

You are in essence skimming again, but this time, instead of seeing the big picture of what you are going to learn, you do a quick survey of what you have learnt.

If you practice retrieval immediately after learning some new data, you are teaching your brain not only to file away important information, but to cement a path via which you can search for and recall that data later on.
==========
Super Learning: Advanced Strategies for Quicker Comprehension, Greater Retention, and Systematic Expertise (Science of Accelerated Learning 2.ed) (Learning how to Learn Book 14) (Hollins, Peter)

Step 4 is to study. The material is there, now you need to make sure it’s taking root in your brain, permanently. The key to this? Repetition. For around 30 to 50 minutes, go over concepts, definitions, problems or ideas, reinforcing your understanding.
==========
Super Learning: Advanced Strategies for Quicker Comprehension, Greater Retention, and Systematic Expertise (Science of Accelerated Learning 2.ed) (Learning how to Learn Book 14) (Hollins, Peter)

The last step is to assess. Here, you want to check how well the process is going. Check how much you’ve retained, but also ask yourself how well your study techniques are working. Try some tests or worked problems and appraise your performance and memory. Based on the outcome, adjust your approach next time.

Interleaving disrupts that sequence. It mixes the practice of several related skills throughout the study session. So the pattern of interleaving would look like ABCABCABC.

Praising the process applauds the effort and work—the action that’s taken to get to the next step. You want to reinforce the idea that talent is less important, whereas effort is everything.

Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers (Gordon Neufeld;Gabor Maté, Md)

For a child to be open to being parented by an adult, he must be actively attaching to that adult, be wanting contact and closeness with him. At the beginning of life this drive to attach is quite physical—the infant literally clings to the parent and needs to be held. If everything unfolds according to design, the attachment will evolve into an emotional closeness and finally a sense of psychological intimacy.

Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers (Gordon Neufeld;Gabor Maté, Md)

Children are increasingly forming attachments that compete with their parents, with the result that the proper context for parenting is less and less available to us. It is not a lack of love or of parenting know-how but the erosion of the attachment context that makes our parenting ineffective.

The more children are attached to caring adults, the more they are able to interact with peers without being overwhelmed by the vulnerability involved.

Whether it is for our children to dress themselves, feed themselves, settle themselves, entertain themselves, think for themselves, solve their own problems, the story is the same: we champion independence—or what we believe is independence. We fear that to invite dependence is to invite regression instead of development, that if we give dependence an inch, it will take a mile. What we are really encouraging with this attitude is not true independence, only independence from us. Dependence is transferred to the peer group.

Why We Sleep (Walker, Matthew)

Many of the explanations for why we sleep circle around a common, and perhaps erroneous, idea: sleep is the state we must enter in order to fix that which has been upset by wake. But what if we turned this argument on its head? What if sleep is so useful—so physiologically beneficial to every aspect of our being—that the real question is: Why did life ever bother to wake up? Considering how biologically damaging the state of wakefulness can often be, that is the true evolutionary puzzle here, not sleep. Adopt this perspective, and we can pose a very different theory: sleep was the first state of life on this planet, and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged. It may be a preposterous hypothesis, but personally I do not think it to be entirely unreasonable.

Why We Sleep (Walker, Matthew)

If you compare the electrical depth of the deep NREM slow brainwaves on one half of someone’s head relative to the other when they are sleeping at home, they are about the same. But if you bring that person into a sleep laboratory, or take them to a hotel—both of which are unfamiliar sleep environments—one half of the brain sleeps a little lighter than the other, as if it’s standing guard with just a tad more vigilance due to the potentially less safe context that the conscious brain has registered while awake. The more nights an individual sleeps in the new location, the more similar the sleep is in each half of the brain. It is perhaps one reason why so many of us sleep so poorly the first night in a hotel room.

A structure located in the left and right sides of the brain, called the amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification in emotional reactivity in the participants who were sleep-deprived. In contrast, the brain scans of those individuals who were given a full night’s sleep evinced a controlled, modest degree of reactivity in the amygdala, despite viewing the very same images. It was as though, without sleep, our brain reverts to a primitive pattern of uncontrolled reactivity. We produce unmetered, inappropriate emotional reactions, and are unable to place events into a broader or considered context.

Inadequate sleep and the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease interact in a vicious cycle. Without sufficient sleep, amyloid plaques build up in the brain, especially in deep-sleep-generating regions, attacking and degrading them. The loss of deep NREM sleep caused by this assault therefore lessens the ability to remove amyloid from the brain at night, resulting in greater amyloid deposition. More amyloid, less deep sleep, less deep sleep, more amyloid, and so on and so forth. From this cascade comes a prediction: getting too little sleep across the adult life span will significantly raise your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

The less you sleep, the more you are likely to eat. In addition, your body becomes unable to manage those calories effectively, especially the concentrations of sugar in your blood. In these two ways, sleeping less than seven or eight hours a night will increase your probability of gaining weight, being overweight, or being obese, and significantly increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.

Take a group of lean, healthy young males in their mid-twenties and limit them to five hours of sleep for one week, as a research group did at the University of Chicago. Sample the hormone levels circulating in the blood of these tired participants and you will find a marked drop in testosterone relative to their own baseline levels of testosterone when fully rested. The size of the hormonal blunting effect is so large that it effectively “ages” a man by ten to fifteen years in terms of testosterone virility.

Concentrations of a key stress-related chemical called noradrenaline are completely shut off within your brain when you enter this dreaming sleep state. In fact, REM sleep is the only time during the twenty-four-hour period when your brain is completely devoid of this anxiety-triggering molecule. Noradrenaline, also known as norepinephrine, is the brain equivalent to a body chemical you already know and have felt the effects of: adrenaline (epinephrine).

Through its therapeutic work at night, REM sleep performed the elegant trick of divorcing the bitter emotional rind from the information-rich fruit. We can therefore learn and usefully recall salient life events without being crippled by the emotional baggage that those painful experiences originally carried.

There are regions of your brain whose job it is to read and decode the value and meaning of emotional signals, especially faces. And it is that very same essential set of brain regions, or network, that REM sleep recalibrates at night.

Second, alcohol will often suppress REM sleep, especially during the first half or two-thirds of the night. When the body metabolizes alcohol it produces by-product chemicals called aldehydes and ketones. The aldehydes in particular will block the brain’s ability to generate REM sleep.

we first need to understand how the body makes energy from air and food. There are two options: with oxygen, a process known as aerobic respiration, and without it, which is called anaerobic respiration.
==========
Breath (James Nestor;)

Anaerobic energy is generated only with glucose (a simple sugar), and it’s quicker and easier for our bodies to access. It’s a kind of backup system and turbo boost when the body doesn’t have enough oxygen. But anaerobic energy is inefficient and can be toxic, creating an excess of lactic acid. The nausea, muscle weakness, and sweating you experience after you’ve pushed it too hard at the gym is the feeling of anaerobic overload. This process explains why the first few minutes of an intense workout are often so miserable. Our lungs and respiratory system haven’t caught up to supply the oxygen our bodies need, and so the body has to use anaerobic respiration. This also explains why, after we’re warmed up, exercise feels easier. The body has switched from anaerobic to aerobic respiration.
==========
Breath (James Nestor;)

Finding the best heart rate for exercise is easy: subtract your age from 180. The result is the maximum your body can withstand to stay in the aerobic state. Long bouts of training and exercise can happen below this rate but never above it, otherwise the body will risk going too deep into the anaerobic zone for too long. Instead of feeling invigorated and strong after a workout, you’d feel tired, shaky, and nauseated.

Mouthbreathing, it turns out, changes the physical body and transforms airways, all for the worse. Inhaling air through the mouth decreases pressure, which causes the soft tissues in the back of the mouth to become loose and flex inward, creating less overall space and making breathing more difficult. Mouthbreathing begets more mouthbreathing.

A typical adult engages as little as 10 percent of the range of the diaphragm when breathing, which overburdens the heart, elevates blood pressure, and causes a rash of circulatory problems. Extending those breaths to 50 to 70 percent of the diaphragm’s capacity will ease cardiovascular stress and allow the body to work more efficiently. For this reason, the diaphragm is sometimes referred to as “the second heart,”

The cellular cruise ship is filled with “guest rooms.” In your blood cells, those rooms are the protein called hemoglobin. Oxygen takes a seat inside a hemoglobin; then the red blood cells journey upstream, deeper into the body. As blood passes through tissues and muscles, oxygen will disembark, providing fuel to hungry cells. As oxygen offloads, other passengers, namely carbon dioxide—the “waste product” of metabolism—will pile aboard, and the cruise ship will begin a return journey back to the lungs. This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide changes the appearance of blood. The blood cells in the veins that carry more carbon dioxide will appear blue; arterial blood, still filled with oxygen, will appear bright red. It’s these gases that give veins and arteries their distinctive colors.
==========
Breath (James Nestor;)

What’s less acknowledged is the role carbon dioxide plays in weight loss. That carbon dioxide in every exhale has weight, and we exhale more weight than we inhale. And the way the body loses weight isn’t through profusely sweating or “burning it off.” We lose weight through exhaled breath.
==========
Breath (James Nestor;)

when breathing at a normal rate, our lungs will absorb only about a quarter of the available oxygen in the air. The majority of that oxygen is exhaled back out. By taking longer breaths, we allow our lungs to soak up more in fewer breaths.

adult lungs can hold about four to six liters of air. Which means that, even if we practice slow breathing at 5.5 breaths per minute, we could still be easily taking in twice the air we need.

adult lungs can hold about four to six liters of air. Which means that, even if we practice slow breathing at 5.5 breaths per minute, we could still be easily taking in twice the air we need. The key to optimum breathing, and all the health, endurance, and longevity benefits that come with it, is to practice fewer inhales and exhales in a smaller volume. To breathe, but to breathe less.

When we breathe too much, we expel too much carbon dioxide, and our blood pH rises to become more alkaline; when we breathe slower and hold in more carbon dioxide, pH lowers and blood becomes more acidic. Almost all cellular functions in the body take place at a blood pH of 7.4, our sweet spot between alkaline and acid.
==========
Breath (James Nestor;)

When we breathe too much, we expel too much carbon dioxide, and our blood pH rises to become more alkaline; when we breathe slower and hold in more carbon dioxide, pH lowers and blood becomes more acidic. Almost all cellular functions in the body take place at a blood pH of 7.4, our sweet spot between alkaline and acid. When we stray from that, the body will do whatever it can to get us back there. The kidneys, for instance, will respond to overbreathing by “buffering,”* a process in which an alkaline compound called bicarbonate is released into the urine. With less bicarbonate in the blood, the pH lowers back to normal, even if we continue to huff and puff. It’s as if nothing ever happened. The problem with buffering is that it’s meant as a temporary fix, not a permanent solution. Weeks, months, or years of overbreathing, and this constant kidney (renal) buffering will deplete the body of essential minerals. This occurs because as bicarbonate leaves the body, it takes magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and more with it. Without healthy stores of these minerals, nothing works right: nerves malfunction, smooth muscles spasm, and cells can’t efficiently create energy. Breathing becomes even more difficult. This is one reason why asthmatics and other people with chronic respiratory problems are prescribed supplements like magnesium to stave off further attacks. Constant buffering also weakens the bones, which try to compensate by dissolving their mineral stores back into the bloodstream. (Yes, it’s possible to overbreathe yourself into osteoporosis and increased risk of bone fractures.)

Many of us adopted this S-posture not because of laziness but because our tongues don’t fit properly in our too-small mouths. Having nowhere else to go, the tongue falls back into the throat, creating a mild suffocation. At night, we choke and cough, attempting to push air in and out of this obstructed airway. This, of course, is sleep apnea, and a quarter of Americans suffer from it.

Breathing is an autonomic function we can consciously control. While we can’t simply decide when to slow or speed up our heart or digestion, or to move blood from one organ to another, we can choose how and when to breathe. Willing ourselves to breathe slowly will open up communication along the vagal network and relax us into a parasympathetic state.

Breath (James Nestor;)

Whenever the body is forced to take in more air than it needs, we’ll exhale too much carbon dioxide, which will narrow the blood vessels and decrease circulation, especially in the brain. With just a few minutes, or even seconds, of overbreathing, brain blood flow can decrease by 40 percent, an incredible amount.
==========
Breath (James Nestor;)

In addition, the sustained pH imbalance in the blood sends distress signals throughout the body, specifically to the limbic system, which controls emotions, arousal, and other instincts. Consciously sustaining these stress signals long enough may trick the more primitive limbic system into thinking the body is dying.

Up to 80 percent of office workers (according to one estimate) suffer from something called continuous partial attention.

The best way to keep tissues in the body healthy was to mimic the reactions that evolved in early aerobic life on Earth—specifically, to flood our bodies with a constant presence of that “strong electron acceptor”: oxygen. Breathing slow, less, and through the nose balances the levels of respiratory gases in the body and sends the maximum amount of oxygen to the maximum amount of tissues so that our cells have the maximum amount of electron reactivity.

The bones in the human face don’t stop growing in our 20s, unlike other bones in the body. They can expand and remodel into our 70s, and likely beyond. Which means we can influence the size and shape of our mouths and improve our ability to breathe at virtually any age.

What, then, triggers them to begin puberty? A few years ago, researchers discovered that puberty is initiated by what appears to be a game of hormonal dominoes, which begins with a gene producing a single protein, named kisspeptin, in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates metabolism. When that protein connects with, or “kisses,” receptors on another gene, it eventually triggers the pituitary gland to release its storage of hormones. Those surges of testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone in turn activate the testes and ovaries.

And yet the brain of an adolescent is nothing short of a paradox. It has an overabundance of gray matter (the neurons that form the basic building blocks of the brain) and an undersupply of white matter (the connective wiring that helps information flow efficiently from one part of the brain to the other)—which is why the teenage brain is almost like a brand-new Ferrari: it’s primed and pumped, but it hasn’t been road tested yet. In other words, it’s all revved up but doesn’t quite know where to go.

Structurally, the human brain is divided into four lobes: frontal (top front), parietal (top back), temporal (sides), and occipital (back). The brain sits on the brainstem, which connects to the spinal cord. In the rear of the brain, the cerebellum regulates motor patterning and coordination, and the occipital lobes house the visual cortex. The parietal lobes house association areas as well as the motor and sensory cortices (which include the homunculus in Figure 2). The temporal lobes include areas involved in the regulation of emotions and sexuality. Language is also located here,
==========
The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

The frontal lobes sit most anteriorly and this area is concerned with executive function, judgment, insight, and impulse control. Importantly, as the brain matures from back to front in the teen years the frontal lobes are the least mature and the least connected compared with the other lobes.
==========
The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

The brain is divided into specialized regions for each of the senses. The area for hearing, or the auditory cortex, is in the temporal lobes; the visual cortex is in the occipital lobes; and the parietal lobes house movement and feeling in the motor and sensory cortices, respectively. Other parts of the brain have nothing to do with the senses, and the best example of this is the frontal lobes, which make up more than 40 percent of the human brain’s total volume—more than in any other animal species. The frontal lobes are the seat of our ability to generate insight, judgment, abstraction, and planning. They are the source of self-awareness and our ability to assess dangers and risk, so we use this area of the brain to choose a course of action wisely.
==========
The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

The very last places to “connect” are the frontal lobes (Figure 4). In fact, the teen brain is only about 80 percent of the way to maturity. That 20 percent gap, where the wiring is thinnest, is crucial and goes a long way toward explaining why teenagers behave in such puzzling ways —their mood swings, irritability, impulsiveness, and explosiveness; their inability to focus, to follow through, and to connect with adults; and their temptations to use drugs and alcohol and to engage in other risky behavior.

Next door to the hippocampus, in another part of the limbic system under the temporal lobe, is another key brain structure, the amygdala, which is involved in sexual and emotional behavior. It is very susceptible to hormones, such as sex hormones and adrenaline. It is sort of the seat of anger, and when stimulated in animal experiments, it has been shown to produce rage-like behavior. The limbic system can be thought of as a kind of crossroads of the brain, where emotions and experiences are integrated.

If you think of each neuron’s cell body as a point in a relay, there must be an incoming and an outgoing signal. Once the outgoing signal reaches the axonal bouton, or end point, it sets off a reaction causing the bouton to release packages of chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters. The point of contact between two neurons is called a synapse, and is actually a space no more than two-millionths of an inch wide. The synapse is truly where the action takes place in the brain. The signal heads down the neuron through the axon to the synapse and is then released as a chemical message. Like liquid keys, these neurotransmitters cross the synapse and lock onto the neuron on the other side, and in this way carry information from one cell to another. Once opened, the receptor causes a chain reaction of signals going down the receiving cell, triggering a pulse, or an action potential, which travels from a dendrite and through the cell body and out the axon toward another cell.

Some of the most common excitatory neurotransmitters are epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glutamate.

A lack of serotonin can result in aggression and depression.
==========
The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

Dopamine is a special neurotransmitter because it is both excitatory and inhibitory. It is also, along with epinephrine and several others, a hormone. When it acts on the adrenal glands, it is acting hormonally; when it acts in the brain, it is a neurotransmitter. As a brain chemical messenger, dopamine helps motivate, drive, and focus the brain because it is integral to the brain’s reward circuitry. It’s the “I gotta have it” neurochemical that not only reinforces goal-directed activity but also can, in certain circumstances, lead to addiction. The more dopamine that is released in the brain, the more the reward circuits are activated, and the more those circuits are activated, the bigger the craving. It doesn’t matter if the craving is at the dinner table or the card table, in the boardroom or the bedroom. For instance, scientists know that high-calorie foods produce more dopamine in the brain. Why? Because higher calories increase our chance for survival. When we crave ice cream or gambling or sex, we may not actually be craving sweets, money, or orgasms. We’re craving dopamine.

myelin is made by oligodendrocytes, and has a white hue due to its fatty content: hence the term “white matter.” By essentially “greasing” the “wires,” myelin allows signals to travel down axons faster, increasing the speed of a neural transmission as much as a hundredfold. Myelin also aids the speed of transmission by helping to cut down the synapses’ recovery time between neural firings, thereby allowing a thirtyfold increase in the frequency with which neurons transmit information.

Teenagers can be, and are, forced to abide by the adult chronotype, with early rising for school. However, this early rising does not result in an early bedtime: the teen brain doesn’t adjust at the other end of the day, and instead has a tendency to hold on to that part of its pattern. The result is a shrunken sleep period. However, on weekends, one sees teenagers immediately slip back into late-morning awakenings, as their internal clock prefers. If they are allowed to sleep as long as they like, teenagers will get around 9 to 10 hours of sleep per night. But if they are made to wake up for school, as shown in Figure 14, they are chronically losing 2.75 hours of sleep daily. This is thought to contribute to a chronic sleep deprivation syndrome.

Because so much is going on in adolescents’ brains, and they are learning so much and at such a fast pace, teenagers need more sleep than either their parents or their much younger siblings.

Beginning at around ages ten to twelve, young people’s biological clock shifts forward, revving them up by about seven and eight o’clock at night and creating a “no sleep” zone around nine or ten o’clock at night, just when parents are starting to feel drowsy. One reason is that melatonin, a hormone critical to inducing sleep, is released two hours later at night in a teenager’s brain than it is in an adult’s. It also stays in the teenager’s system longer, and this is why it’s so hard to wake your high schooler up in the morning. Adults, on the other hand, have almost no melatonin in their system when they wake up and therefore don’t have the same groggy feeling.

Those who begin smoking in adolescence are also three times more likely to begin using alcohol, and long-term ingestion of nicotine has been shown to increase tolerance to alcohol, meaning it takes more alcohol to produce the same effect. Not surprisingly, smokers are ten times more likely than nonsmokers to develop alcoholism. For those teens who set off down this path, the effects of drinking are far more pronounced and the compulsion to do it again far greater than for adults who have recently decided to take this trip. Unfortunately, that compulsion, when coupled with an immature teenage cortex, frequently leads to catastrophic consequences.

Early teen users are twice as likely to become addicted, and those who indulge in pot before the age of sixteen have more trouble with focus and attention and make twice as many mistakes on tests involving planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking. Also, the younger a pot smoker is, the more he or she smokes. Bottom line: The earlier the use, the greater the abuse.

Adolescent brains are not as resilient as adult brains when it comes to marijuana. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to the drug because they are at a critical stage in the development of two of the most sophisticated parts of their brains—the frontal and prefrontal cortex—and these are precisely the parts most affected by marijuana.

The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

Recent research shows that fear of losing their parents’ trust and respect is the greatest deterrent to adolescents’ drug use. They won’t tell you this, of course, but when asked by researchers what prevents them from experimenting, a majority of non-drug-using teenagers say it’s because their parents expected them not to and that their parents would be disappointed in them if they did.

The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

Craving and relapse are hallmarks of drug addiction, and teens get hooked on drugs harder and faster than adults precisely because so many of the drugs target the very active reward system in their brains. Because the nucleus accumbens is still maturing during adolescence, its functioning is characterized by a search for the highest excitement with the least amount of effort expended. In fact, it takes less than three months for adolescents to transition from experimentation to weekly use.

The Teenage Brain (Frances E. Jensen)

the brain responds to the hyperactivity of dopamine by reducing dopamine receptors, and a loss of receptors means less stimulation. The result is called tolerance. The addict must take increasingly larger doses of the drug to obtain the same high he or she experienced the first time around. And with the reward pathways so hypersensitized to being stimulated, withdrawal also comes quickly and is more pronounced than in adults, leaving the teenage drug abuser susceptible to anxiety, irritability, and depression and therefore even more determined to get high again.

Faced with a stressful situation, the amygdala is the first to respond, and when stimulated, it releases stress hormones that signal the pituitary gland to release certain chemicals, which then prompt the adrenal gland to release adrenaline (also known as epinephrine). The adrenal glands are located right above the kidneys, and when activated in highly stressful situations, they put the body in position to respond to danger by raising the heart rate, dilating blood vessels, increasing oxygen, and redirecting blood away from the digestive tract and into the muscles

Because the brain is so precious, it is protected not only by the skull and a bath of cerebrospinal fluid; the blood-brain barrier also effectively walls off the brain from the body’s blood supply. When working properly, this wall lets oxygen, glucose, and other necessary substances across the barrier but stops larger, sometimes toxic, molecules from getting into the brain. Gaps can form in this barrier, however, thereby letting harmful molecules enter the brain and accumulate. The result is a gradual swelling of the brain, which increases the pressure inside the cranium and inhibits blood flow to the brain.

In type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, a person cannot make insulin because the body has killed the specialized cells in the pancreas needed to make insulin. For this reason, those with type 1 diabetes have to inject themselves with insulin to make up for their lack of being able to produce the substance on their own. Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterized by chronic high blood sugar that causes dramatic surges in insulin so high that cells become desensitized to the hormone.

The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

Long before humans walked the earth, plants protected themselves and their offspring from hungry insects by producing toxins, including lectins, in the plants’ seeds and other parts. It turns out the same plant toxins that can kill or immobilize an insect can also silently destroy your health and insidiously impact your weight. I titled this book The Plant Paradox because while many plant foods are good for you—and form the bedrock of my eating plan—others that have been regarded as “health foods” are actually to blame for making you sick and overweight. That’s right, most plants actually want to make you ill. Another paradox: small portions of some plants are good for you but large amounts are bad for you.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

Glucose raises insulin levels in primates and humans, which initially raises levels of leptin, a hunger-blocking hormone—but fructose does not. As a result, the predator never receives the normal message that it is full, which would signal it to stop eating.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

when you buy fruit in North America in December, it was likely grown in Chile or another country in the Southern Hemisphere, picked slightly unripe, and then given a blast of ethylene oxide when it arrived at its destination. The ethylene oxide exposure changes the color to make the fruit appear ripe and ready to eat, but the lectin content remains high because the protective coating of the seed never fully matured and the fruit never got the message from the parent plant to reduce the lectin content. Again, when fruit is allowed to ripen naturally, the parent plant reduces the amount of lectins surrounding the seeds in the fruit and skin and then communicates this information by changing color. In contrast, gassing artificially changes the color of the fruit, but the lectin protection system remains in effect. Thanks to the high lectin count, eating fruit picked too early is detrimental to your health.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

There is no advantage to being carried off, so the plant must discourage insects or other animals from consuming its babies and transporting them elsewhere. Instead of a hard casing, the naked seed contains one or more chemicals that weaken predators, paralyze them, or make them ill, so they won’t make the mistake of eating the plant again. These substances include phytates, often referred to as antinutrients, which prevent absorption of minerals in the diet; trypsin inhibitors, which keep digestive enzymes from doing their job, interfering with the predator’s growth; and lectins, which are designed to disrupt cellular communication by, among other things, causing gaps in the intestinal wall barrier, a condition known as leaky gut. Whole grains actually contain all three of these defensive chemicals in the fibrous hull, husk, and bran. (Teaser alert: This is just one reason that the idea of “whole-grain goodness” is a huge misconception, as

LECTIN ATTACK STRATEGY #3: Disrupt Cellular Communication Some lectins also disrupt transmissions between your cells by mimicking or blocking hormonal signals. 18 Hormones are proteins that fit into actual docking ports on the walls of all cells and release information about what the hormone wants a cell to do. For example, the hormone insulin enables cells to allow glucose to enter and provide fuel. If there is excess glucose, insulin attaches to fat cells and directs them to store the glucose as fat for use when there’s less food. Once the hormone releases information, the cell informs the hormone that the message has been received and the hormone backs out of the dock, so the dock is ready for the next hormone. In order to do any of these things, the docking port for insulin has to be open and available. However, lectins can bind to important docking ports on cell walls, either giving wrong information or blocking release of the correct important docking ports on cell walls, either giving wrong information or blocking release of the correct information. For example, the lectin WGA bears a striking resemblance to insulin. 19 It can attach to the insulin docking port as if it were the actual insulin molecule, but unlike the real hormone, it never lets go—with devastating results, including reduced muscle mass, starved brain and nerve cells, and plenty of fat. Ouch!

Gluten (gliadin specifically) is bad for you because gliadin triggers an excessive release of zonulin, which causes the tight junctions between the intestinal cells to open wider, producing a leaky gut. As we have discussed, zonulin is a protein in charge of opening and closing the tiny barriers in the gut wall. So the more zonulin release you have, the more inflammation and potential for an autoimmune response you will have as a direct result.

Over hundreds of millions of years, plants have evolved a strategy of creating proteins (like lectins) that bear a striking resemblance to critical structures in their predators. When lectins get through the gut wall, they activate the immune system, which starts shooting without first asking questions—and that means it may shoot both at the lectins and also at the critical structures that resemble the lectins.

The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

gulping down apparently harmless NSAIDs is like swallowing a live grenade. These drugs blow gaping holes in the mucus-lined intestinal barrier. As a result, lectins, LPSs, and living bacteria are able to deluge the breaks in your levee, flooding your body with foreign invaders. Inundated by these foreign proteins and other invaders, your immune system does what it does best, producing inflammation and pain. This pain in turn prompts you to down another NSAID, promoting a vicious cycle, which can ultimately result in your seeking out prescription-level pain relievers.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

NSAIDs, antibiotics, acid-blocking drugs such as Nexium and Prilosec, and the biocide Roundup all change your gut flora and the mucous layer of your gut. This compromises the barrier wall of your intestines on a daily basis, thereby allowing lectins in. And this confluence of forces prompts your immune system to unleash an attack on you, in a classic case of mistaken identity caused by molecular mimicry. As a reminder, molecular mimicry is caused by our immune cells attacking proteins on cells or organs that resemble the patterns on lectins and LPSs.

Insulin’s primary job is to open the door to any cell to allow glucose to enter and provide fuel, particularly to three important types of cells. 1. IN FAT CELLS, insulin attaches to a docking port on a fat cell membrane and flips a switch that tells the fat cell to convert that glucose to fat and store it. When insulin has done its job, it separates from the docking port and no more sugar can enter the cell. 2. IN MUSCLE CELLS, insulin unlocks the door to the cell and ushers in glucose to be used as fuel. 3. NERVE CELLS (neurons) also require insulin to admit glucose through their cell membrane. The fact that neurons require insulin to get glucose is a relatively new finding, and we now know that insulin resistance also occurs in the brain and nerves—it is called type 3 diabetes. Once insulin docks in the appropriate ports and releases information, the fat, muscle, or nerve cells tell the hormone that the message has been received. The hormone then backs out of the docking port, leaving it ready and available for the next hormone to attach.

Normally, when sugar enters the bloodstream from our gut, the pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream, and the insulin then travels to three main places: fat cells, muscle cells, and neurons. Insulin’s primary job is to open the door to any cell to allow glucose to enter and provide fuel, particularly to three important types of cells. 1. IN FAT CELLS, insulin attaches to a docking port on a fat cell membrane and flips a switch that tells the fat cell to convert that glucose to fat and store it. When insulin has done its job, it separates from the docking port and no more sugar can enter the cell. 2. IN MUSCLE CELLS, insulin unlocks the door to the cell and ushers in glucose to be used as fuel. 3. NERVE CELLS (neurons) also require insulin to admit glucose through their cell membrane. The fact that neurons require insulin to get glucose is a relatively new finding, and we now know that insulin resistance also occurs in the brain and nerves—it is called type 3 diabetes. Once insulin docks in the appropriate ports and releases information, the fat, muscle, or nerve cells tell the hormone that the message has been received. The hormone then backs out of the docking port, leaving it ready and available for the next hormone to attach. Problems arise when lectins mimic insulin and bind to those docking ports on cell walls instead. The lectins either give the wrong information or block the release of the correct information.

It takes only half the effort to turn ketones into ATP than it does with sugar,
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

When you eat sugar or protein— remember protein is the “new sugar” and is converted to sugar 1 —your pancreas squirts out insulin to usher sugar into the mitochondrial factories. However, if the factories are running at full tilt, insulin and its sugar cargo are turned away at the receiving dock. Instead, insulin instructs an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase to make fat cells turn sugar into more fat to store for later use.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

mitochondria cannot process fat directly from your fat cells. Instead, an enzyme called hormone-sensitive lipase has to turn your stored fat into a usable form of fat called a ketone. Your body works in elegant ways. Insulin is the single hormone to which this enzyme is sensitive. So, if your insulin level is high, your brain assumes that you must be chowing down for the coming winter, converting everything you eat into fat to tide you over when pickings are slim. And it assumes that the last thing you want to do right then is convert that fat into ketones. So, insulin keeps hormone-sensitive lipase from working. On the other hand, if it’s winter and you’re not eating much, hormone-sensitive lipase is unblocked because there is no insulin being produced—and away you go, making ketones
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

If you eat 365 days a year as though it is endless summer, your insulin level stays high, the workers are on strike, and you can’t access all that stored fat because high insulin is blocking hormone-sensitive lipase.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

Again, the excess protein morphs into sugar and results in insulin release, which blocks the action of the hormone-sensitive lipase, preventing fat from converting to ketones. The side effects of this blockage typically manifest as headaches, low energy, aches, and the so-called Atkins or low-carb flu. To be clear, you have to cut out not only sugars but also proteins to stop this process.
==========
The Plant Paradox (Steven Gundry)

Unlike in normal cells, the mitochondria in cancer cells are unable to use ketones to generate ATP. Nor do they choose to combine sugar with oxygen to generate ATP, the way normal cells act. Instead, cancer cell mitochondria rely on the extremely inefficient system of sugar fermentation also used by yeasts and bacteria. This means that the average cancer cell needs up to eighteen times more sugar to grow and divide than do normal cells! 2 That’s not all. Cancer cells prefer to ferment sugar in the form of fructose rather than glucose, so there’s another reason to give fruit the boot

Though the genome of a bacterium is only one-tenth of a human cell’s genome, National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers recently showed that the microbiome contributes 8 million unique genes to human bodies. This means there are 360 times as many bacterial genes as human genes within you or me!5 Since bacteria replicate (divide) so quickly and have that much genetic “computing power,” our gut buddies are capable of almost instantaneous information processing and communicating, even to the point of influencing our thoughts and actions.

You inherited both your gut buddies and your mitochondria from your mother. As a refresher, mitochondria are engulfed bacteria that live in all your cells. They contain their own mitochondrial DNA (genes) that actually divide separately from the rest of the cell’s DNA contained in the nucleus. (Didn’t you just love high school biology?) All mitochondrial DNA is transmitted through the female egg from mother to child. So all mitochondria and their DNA are female. Likewise, your mother initially populated your gut microbiome at birth with her bacteria as you traveled down the birth canal and were exposed to the bacteria in her vagina. This elegant system continued even further when your mother nursed you for the first time. Amazingly, her milk contained specific sugar molecules called oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides that you couldn’t digest but were the exact type of food the gut buddies she’d just passed onto you liked best. In other words, Mom was feeding two infants at once: you and your newly introduced (from her) microbiome.

Your stomach acids, enzymes, and gut buddies break down the food you eat into individual components: amino acids (from protein), fatty acids (from fat), and sugar molecules (from sugars and starches). Your mucosal cells then literally bite off a single molecule of these digested amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars, pass it through the body of the cell, and release it into your portal vein or lymph system.
==========
The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

Normally, when the cells in your gut bite off a single molecule of sugar and pass it into the bloodstream, the pancreas responds by secreting insulin, a hormone that regulates the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Insulin works by opening the door to your cells and allowing glucose to enter. The mitochondria in both muscle cells and neurons then “digest” the glucose, using oxygen to create energy. When there is more glucose available than your muscles need (and if you are sitting all day, they don’t need much!), insulin attaches to a docking port on the cell membrane of fat cells and flips an enzymatic switch called lipoprotein lipase that tells the fat cell to convert that glucose to fat and store it in the cell. No matter what type of cell, once the insulin has done its job of ushering glucose inside, the insulin separates from the docking port so the cell is ready to receive the next hormonal signal.

No matter what type of cell, once the insulin has done its job of ushering glucose inside, the insulin separates from the docking port so the cell is ready to receive the next hormonal signal. This system goes completely awry when WGA is absorbed after you eat whole wheat products. WGA locks onto the insulin hormonal docking port on the cell membrane, but unlike a “normal” hormone, which would dock, release its information, and leave, WGA doesn’t let go. Instead, it keeps the switch open. This causes fat cells to continue ushering in more and more sugar to store as fat. In contrast, in muscle cells, real insulin cannot dock at the port because it is blocked by the WGA. This means that your mitochondria can’t get the glucose they need to create energy. Without energy, your cells die. Many people assume that muscle wasting is a normal part of aging, but that is not the case. This insulin mimicry is one of the main causes of muscle wasting as we age because muscle cells die when they cannot get glucose for energy. But don’t panic; muscles and the rest of you have a backup power supply that we’ll get to shortly. Worst of all, WGA locks onto the docking port of nerve cells, starving them of energy, too. Your brain needs a lot of energy to function. So when sugar is locked out of your neurons, your brain responds angrily, demanding that you eat more food. Of course, your brain cells don’t understand that the sugar from any food you eat will just continue to go straight into your fat cells because the insulin docks on all of your other cells are being blocked. No matter how much you eat, your muscle and brain cells will starve and your fat cells will feast.

we stored glucose and excess protein as glycogen, a form of sugar we can store in our muscles and liver, and used that sugar for energy until more food was available. If we used up all of our glycogen before we got more food, our mitochondria were able to switch from “digesting” glucose for energy to “digesting” a fat-derived fuel called ketones.

iron is a component of hemoglobin, a substance in your red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body. And your mitochondria use oxygen to “digest” either glucose or fat molecules to produce energy. So on the surface it would seem that the more iron you have in your blood, the more oxygen can get into the mitochondria and the more energy they can produce. But the opposite appears to be true.

About two thousand years ago, a spontaneous mutation in northern European cows changed the type of protein in their milk from casein A2 to casein A1. During digestion, casein A1 can turn into beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide53 that attaches to the pancreas’s insulin-producing cells and prompts an immune attack (and thus inflammation). This is likely a primary cause of type 1 diabetes.
==========
The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

Goats, sheep, and water buffalo were not affected by the mutation, so their milk still contains the healthier casein A2 protein.

And please stay away from plain old milk as a beverage, particularly for your children. Cow’s milk is loaded with insulin-like growth factor 1, or IGF-1 (after all, it’s designed to make calves grow quickly). Human milk has far lower amounts of IGF-1, as we are designed to be very slow growing. As we mentioned earlier, fast growth is problematic in so many ways. So, no, milk doesn’t do a body good.

The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

When you eat excess starch or sugars (or protein, which we’ll discuss in a moment) anything you don’t need for immediate fuel is carried to your liver, where it is transformed into a fat called a triglyceride. Then you need moving vans, which are low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), a type of cholesterol, to carry triglycerides from the liver to cells throughout your body. Once distributed there, they’ll be stored as fat or used to make hormones.

The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

So why do we still think of fruit as a health food? It is healthy if it is eaten as it was meant to be—during the summer, when it is fresh and in season and when we are in a natural growth cycle. When we ate fruit only during the summer, we could handle it in small doses because we then had nine months to detox before the next growth cycle. Eating fruit year-round is terribly aging!
==========
The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

And in fact, eating protein also raises triglyceride levels. Believe it or not, you have no real storage system for protein. Your body needs protein for maintenance of cell membranes and intracellular structures and when you are actively building muscle, but it converts any excess protein into sugar, because you do have a storage system for sugar. This process of converting protein into sugar is called gluconeogenesis. And if you make too much sugar, bingo!—you simply convert that into fat or triglycerides. This is why many people who turn to high-protein diets struggle with high triglyceride levels and insulin resistance. The real trick is to avoid high triglycerides by avoiding the consumption of excess animal protein and simple starches.

most people believe that alcohol causes cirrhosis of the liver, but in fact you can bathe the liver in alcohol all day long and it will never develop cirrhosis. What alcohol in excess does cause is a leaky gut by directly damaging the gut wall, which in turn allows bad bugs and LPSs to enter the portal vein, which delivers them directly to the liver.

Again it goes back to the 365-days-a-year growth cycle in which we currently live that is so rich with opportunity for cancer cell growth. When your microbiome and your cells’ energy sensor, mTOR, send the signal that food is plentiful and your cells should prioritize growth, there is no opportunity for your body to take stock and prune any cells that look odd or dysfunctional. This is a deadly problem—literally—because we have abnormal cells all the time. It is normal to have abnormal cells. What is not normal is constantly encouraging those abnormal cells to grow by feeding them an endless abundance of energy (aka food). You absolutely must give your body a chance to reset and prune those abnormal cells by regularly but temporarily restricting your energy intake. Ironically, it’s restricting energy that allows your mitochondria to more effectively produce energy for your healthy, noncancerous cells. Right now, your mitochondria are constantly working to produce energy from the molecules of food sent to them by their gut buddy sisters. But it’s very difficult for them to keep up. Remember, when you eat sugar or protein, your pancreas releases insulin to usher sugar into cells so it can be processed by your mitochondria. But if each cell’s receiving dock is already full, insulin has to put the extra sugar somewhere—and it ends up being stored as fat for later use. This is a great system, but if you keep eating sugar, protein, or WGA (which, as you read earlier, binds to those loading docks), your pancreas has to keep producing more and more insulin to convert the sugar to fat. This is the root cause of insulin resistance, but it also leads to excess glucose molecules that are free for the taking. And guess who wants to take this sugar and use it to grow? Cancer cells. And guess what stimulates them to grow? Insulin! Insulin is another growth hormone; it’s Miracle Grow to cancer cells.
==========
The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

Remember, your body produces ketones when insulin levels are low and sugar and protein are in short supply—during times of regression—and cancer cells thrive on sugar. Cancer cells are also unwilling to utilize sugar molecules to produce energy the way regular cells do when insulin levels are high. Strangely, the mitochondria in cancer cells create energy only through the extremely inefficient system of sugar fermentation. As a result, the average cancer cell needs up to eighteen times as much sugar to grow and divide as normal cells.27 It’s therefore very easy to starve cancer cells to death. They cannot grow and thrive without lots and lots of sugar.

So what can you do to make your muscles hungrier? You’ve probably already guessed that the answer is exercise—specifically, strength-training exercises that grow muscle mass. When you exercise your muscles, they get hungry and start screaming for food. This makes it easy for insulin to sell them sugar instead of storing it as fat. Your insulin level decreases because the salespeople don’t need as much backup, and your fat mass is reduced.

researchers discovered a system that allows cerebrospinal fluid (that clear fluid that we tap when we stick a needle into your spine) to flow through the brain, cleaning out the spaces in between cells, just as lymphatic fluid does in the rest of your body. This is called the glymphatic system. To make room for the fluid to wash out your brain, your cells actually shrink in size when you are in a deep sleep. This allows the full “brain wash” process to go twenty times as fast when you are in deep sleep as when you are awake and helps to explain why a good night’s sleep is so restorative.19 When you get an adequate amount of deep sleep, you literally wake up with a refreshed and rejuvenated mind that has been swept clean of junk and debris.
==========
The Longevity Paradox: 4 (The Plant Paradox) (Gundry, MD, Steven R.)

The glymphatic system is most active during the specific stage of deep sleep that happens very early in the sleep cycle. And the glymphatic system, just like your digestive system, requires a great deal of blood flow. This means that if you eat too soon before going to bed, your blood will all flow to your gut to aid in digestion and will not be able to reach your brain to complete the all-important brain wash.

Yet sometimes when we get the things we want, it’s not as pleasant as we expect. Dopaminergic excitement (that is, the thrill of anticipation) doesn’t last forever, because eventually the future becomes the present. The thrilling mystery of the unknown becomes the boring familiarity of the everyday, at which point dopamine’s job is done, and the letdown sets in.
==========
The Molecule of More (Lieberman, Daniel Z.)

From dopamine’s point of view, having things is uninteresting. It’s only getting things that matters. If you live under a bridge, dopamine makes you want a tent. If you live in a tent, dopamine makes you want a house. If you live in the most expensive mansion in the world, dopamine makes you want a castle on the moon. Dopamine has no standard for good, and seeks no finish line. The dopamine circuits in the brain can be stimulated only by the possibility of whatever is shiny and new, never mind how perfect things are at the moment. The dopamine motto is “More.”
==========
The Molecule of More (Lieberman, Daniel Z.)

Dopamine isn’t the pleasure molecule, after all. It’s the anticipation molecule. To enjoy the things we have, as opposed to the things that are only possible, our brains must transition from future-oriented dopamine to present-oriented chemicals, a collection of neurotransmitters we call the Here and Now molecules, or the H&Ns. Most people have heard of the H&Ns. They include serotonin, oxytocin, endorphins (your brain’s version of morphine), and a class of chemicals called endocannabinoids (your brain’s version of marijuana).

Dopamine circuits don’t process experience in the real world, only imaginary future possibilities. For many people it’s a letdown. They’re so attached to dopaminergic stimulation that they flee the present and take refuge in the comfortable world of their own imagination.

The cell is nature’s basic building block of life. Each of us is composed of ten trillion cells, most of them specialized and residing in different organs. In order to stay alive, a cell has to burn energy. Any cell can (and normally does) burn glucose, a simple sugar and the building block of starch. The liver and adipose (fat) tissue need the hormone insulin (released from the pancreas) to open the metabolic door within the membrane, the bag that holds the cell together, to let the glucose enter the cell; however, other organs don’t need insulin for glucose entry. But if glucose is in short supply and insulin levels are low, then adipose tissue will give up some of its stored fatty acids to enter the bloodstream, and the liver will turn those fatty acids into ketones, which then seep back into the bloodstream, so that any cell can burn those ketones instead, even without insulin.

Cells are magicians. They either make glucose disappear, or if there’s too much, then presto-change-o, they turn glucose into fat, which wreaks havoc on metabolism. But how and when is the key. Once inside the cell (Fig. 7–1), glucose undergoes breakdown through a series of metabolic steps called glycolysis to the intermediate pyruvic acid, releasing only a small amount of energy, which is captured within a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). From there, the pyruvic acid has one of two choices: 1) either enter the mitochondria (the energy-burning factories inside the cell), where the metabolic breakdown continues, a process called the Krebs cycle, to yield a lot more ATP (and making the waste product carbon dioxide, which you breathe out from the lungs); or 2) if the mitochondria are busy or dysfunctional, the pyruvic acid diverts to a process called de novo lipogenesis (new fat-making) to turn into a fatty acid called palmitic acid, which is then bound to a glycerol molecule and exported out of the liver cell as a triglyceride particle. These two pathways of energy metabolism, especially within the mitochondria, consistently release toxic by-products inside the cell called oxygen radicals (kind of like what hydrogen peroxide does on a wound). If not detoxified, these can damage the cell, and even cause it to die. Therefore, the cell has another structure called a peroxisome, which is where various antioxidants are stored to neutralize the oxygen radicals.

Glycation Why do we get cataracts and wrinkles as we get older? Each of these is an example of an undeniable and inevitable fact of life—the Maillard or glycation or browning or caramelization reaction. All four terms describe the same process, which is the primary process of aging. First described by Professor Louis Camille Maillard in 1912, this process occurs in all living cells. It doesn’t need any energy or enzymes or cofactors or other nutrients, it just happens. It’s a by-product of living, yet it’s the primary reason for dying. We’re all browning, all the time, and the only way to stop it is by dying. The faster the Maillard reaction occurs, the faster you age—you get wrinkles, your arteries become sclerotic, and you eventually reach the pearly gates. But you can slow this process down—and if you’re successful, you’ll be a lot healthier for a lot longer. The Maillard reaction only needs two molecules to occur: a carbohydrate (fructose or glucose), plus an amino acid (e.g., proteins). Put them together and the protein starts to “brown” and become less flexible. Ideally, these damaged proteins will be cleared away by cellular waste processing systems, but if the reaction occurs faster than the waste can be cleared, eventually the buildup of advanced glycation end products, or AGEs, will lead to cell, organ, and human dysfunction. The question is not if the Maillard reaction will occur, but rather how fast. And this is where the metabolic differences between glucose and fructose becomes important (see Chapters 2 and 12). One might think that glucose and fructose, both being molecules found in dietary sugar (sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, agave—they’re all metabolically the same; take your pick), would drive this reaction at the same rate. You would be very wrong. Yes, they’re both carbohydrates, and yes, they both bind to proteins, but that’s where their similarities end. Because glucose has a six-member-ring structure (see Fig. 7–2), it’s more stable and engages in the Maillard reaction relatively slowly. Conversely, fructose’s five-member ring is more easily broken apart, and engages in the Maillard reaction seven times faster than glucose. It also generates one hundred times the number of oxygen radicals (see Oxidative Stress below). Furthermore, our research group has shown that a specific breakdown product of fructose, called methylglyoxal, drives the Maillard reaction 250 times faster than glucose. All in all, when it comes to aging, fructose is worse than glucose, and therefore sugar is worse than starch. That doesn’t make glucose “good”—it raises insulin and drives obesity—but compared to fructose, it’s a walk in the park.

Inside our white blood cells, oxygen undergoes a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called superoxide dismutase (SOD), which turns O2 (the stuff we breathe) into O2—, an oxygen radical or reactive oxygen species, similar to how water (H20) can be turned into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When you put hydrogen peroxide on a wound, it bubbles and fizzes as the liberated oxygen radicals kill everything in sight. And that’s great if you’re cleaning a wound. But this process occurs in all of our cells all of the time. Oxygen radicals are a standard by-product of three normal reactions in the body: glycation; energy metabolism in our mitochondria; and iron metabolism (equivalent to rusting, which is constantly occurring in all of our cells). Furthermore, oxygen radicals are formed in response to anything that causes inflammation. Thus, each cell in our body ordinarily has to deal with an oxygen radical pool; if unleashed they would kill us pretty quickly. Each of our cells possesses specialized subcellular organelles called peroxisomes, which is where antioxidants lie in wait to quench incoming oxygen radicals and render them inert (see Chapter 19). But if there are more oxygen radicals than antioxidants (termed oxidative stress), it causes cellular dysfunction, structural damage to lipids, proteins, or DNA, and in the extreme, cell death. When this happens in the liver and the pancreas, you get diabetes. It’s also why we need to consume Real Food that has color, because color is an indication that these plants contain the antioxidants we can’t make on our own.

Mitochondria are really bacteria that decided eons ago that they were happier living inside of animal-based cells than facing the cold, cruel world on their own. Bacteria were great at burning energy, while animal cells were great at fending off invaders—so they made a symbiotic decision to stick together. To this day, mitochondria have their own DNA and their own genetic program apart from the human DNA found in the nucleus of the cell. But like the shift workers, mitochondria tend to go defective with time and are prone to oxidative stress and damage. Mitochondria are finicky, lose capacity easily, and constantly need to be renewed and replenished. They need to divide, and the cell needs to clear the old ones out. The single best stimulus to make more and fresh mitochondria is exercise—but even your mitochondria can’t outrun a bad diet

When glucose and oxygen availability, as well as mitochondrial capacity, are all matched, everything goes smoothly. Using the coal factory analogy, when the glucose comes in faster than the mitochondria (stokers) process it, the excess chokes off the factory. The mitochondria have no choice but to divert the excess pyruvic acid into fat, a process called de novo lipogenesis (new fat-making). When this happens in the liver, you get fatty liver, which leads to liver insulin resistance (see Insulin Resistance below). If instead this happens in the pancreas, you get fatty pancreas and insulin deficiency. And fructose (in processed food) makes twice as much liver fat as does glucose.

That’s what sleep is for—our intracerebral pressure goes down during sleep, which opens small pores within the brain called glymphatics. An ebb tide fluid shifts slowly during sleep to remove damaged cellular components into the bloodstream for disposal. In other words, in the brain, every night is garbage night. And if you don’t get enough sleep, it’s like having your brain’s garbagemen on strike. But this isn’t just good for the brain—all organs do better with autophagy, which is an essential process that maintains healthy cells by removing damaged proteins and malfunctioning organelles, especially mitochondria. Old mitochondria make a lot of oxygen radicals. Therefore, to improve metabolism and slow aging, it’s essential to get rid of the old mitochondria by autophagy.

There are three protein checkpoints (like traffic lights) inside the cell called kinases that determine what happens to each molecule of glucose or fructose; these are turned on and off within seconds by the addition of a phosphate molecule generated from the food we eat. When the three checkpoints (which we’ll call Alpha, Bravo, Charlie) are coordinated in one direction, you get growth. When they are coordinated in the opposite direction, you get burning. But when they are uncoordinated, that’s when you get a traffic jam and chronic metabolic disease happens.

The first pathway is called glycolysis (see Chapter 7), which prepares glucose to be used for structural components, and pyruvic acid is the end product. If the pyruvic acid is not used for burning in the next stage, it can leave the cell as lactic acid. Glycolysis provides the added bonus of generating a grand total of two ATPs, all without needing oxygen. The second pathway is called the Krebs cycle (see Chapter 7). The pyruvic acid enters the mitochondria, where it burns all the way to completion, at the end of which you have twenty-eight ATPs and carbon dioxide. If the goal is burning (e.g., aerobic exercise), you need both glycolysis and the Krebs cycle working in tandem. If the goal is structural components for growth (e.g., blood flow restriction, or bodybuilders using high-intensity interval training to build muscle mass), then you only need glycolysis, and the pyruvic acid will be diverted for building muscle.

When a cell has used up its ATPs, the mitochondria need to burn pyruvic acid completely, to generate twenty-eight new ATPs to replete the cell’s energy stores (with the waste product of carbon dioxide). AMP-kinase has the added bonus of signaling the cell to make more mitochondria in order to burn more glucose to make even more ATP. Anything that gooses AMP-kinase, like exercise or the anti-diabetes drug metformin, will keep mitochondria functioning optimally and improve insulin sensitivity. But on the other hand, when a cell has too much ATP, AMP-kinase gets turned off. Mitochondria aren’t burning, and the cell will divert the pyruvic acid to make structural components. Anything that impairs AMP-kinase will drive fat synthesis and worsen insulin resistance. And what food impairs AMP-kinase the most? Sugar, of course.

Mother’s, cow’s, and other mammalian milks contain a special sugar called lactose, which is composed of two molecules—glucose and galactose bound together.

However, you don’t hear much about galactose. When an adult consumes galactose, it goes straight to the liver and is converted immediately to glucose. Many adults don’t drink milk, and adults have no need for galactose. So why does it exist? Why is it important? Why is it exclusively in mammalian milk? Milk is food for babies; and babies, even more than children or adults, need to grow two parts of the body—the brain and the immune system.

Most critically, resting metabolism is what the body has opted to spend on maintenance, not what it needs to spend.

As the day marches on, we store memories in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which functions as a short-term storage center like a USB drive. Then, during NREM sleep, the brain triages these memories, rejecting the innumerable useless ones (like what color socks the man sitting next to me on the subway wore) and sending the important ones to long-term storage centers near the surface of the brain. The brain apparently also tags and sorts memories, identifying and strengthening ones we may need. And, fantastically, the brain may also analyze certain memories during REM sleep, integrating them and looking for patterns.

To rid itself of waste, the brain evolved a novel plumbing system that relies on sleep. During NREM sleep, specialized cells throughout the brain expand the spaces between neurons by as much as 60 percent, allowing cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain to literally flush away this junk.16 These opened spaces also admit enzymes that repair damaged cells and rejuvenate receptors in the brain for neurotransmitters.17 The only catch, however, is that the brain’s interstitial pathways are like single-lane bridges that let cars pass in only one direction at a time. Apparently, we cannot think while cleansing our brains. We thus must sleep to flush out the cobwebs left behind by the day’s experiences. Sleep is therefore a necessary trade-off that improves brain function at the cost of time. For every hour spent awake storing memories and amassing waste, we need approximately fifteen minutes asleep to process those memories and clean up.

Sugar is synonymous with sweetness, but it’s first and foremost a fuel used to recharge ATPs through a process termed glycolysis (from glyco for “sugar” and lysis for “break down”). During glycolysis, enzymes swiftly snip sugar molecules in half, liberating the energy from those bonds to charge two ATPs.19 Restoring ATPs from sugar doesn’t require oxygen and is rapid enough to provide almost half the energy used during a thirty-second sprint.20 In fact, a fit human can store enough sugar to run nearly fifteen miles. But there is a consequential catch: during glycolysis the leftover halves of each sugar, molecules known as pyruvates, accumulate faster than cells can handle. As pyruvates pile up to intolerable levels, enzymes convert each pyruvate into a molecule called lactate along with a hydrogen ion (H+). Although lactate is harmless and eventually used to recharge ATPs, those hydrogen ions make muscle cells increasingly acidic, causing fatigue, pain, and decreased function.

Life demands oxygen, especially if you want to run far. In fact, using oxygen to burn a molecule of sugar yields a whopping eighteen times more ATP than glycolysis. But, once again, there is a trade-off: aerobic metabolism provides substantially more energy but substantially more slowly because it requires a long sequence of steps and an army of enzymes.22 These steps occur within specialized structures in cells known as mitochondria that are capable of burning not only the pyruvates that come from sugar but also fats and, in emergencies, proteins. Sugars and fats, however, are burned at different rates. Although my body stores enough fat to run about thirteen hundred miles, fat takes many more steps, hence much more time, to break down and burn than sugar. At rest, about 70 percent of a body’s energy comes from slowly burning fat, but the faster we run, the more sugar we must burn. At maximum aerobic capacity we burn exclusively sugar.

grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncles, and other older individuals in foraging populations from Australia to South America remain active throughout life, gathering and hunting more calories every day than they consume, which they provide to younger generations.13 This surplus food helps provide adequate calories to children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews and reduces how much work mothers have to do. Elderly hunter-gatherers also help younger generations by contributing knowledge, wisdom, and skills for about two to three decades beyond childbearing years.

According to this idea, human longevity was not only selected for but also made possible by having to work moderately during old age to help as many children, grandchildren, and other younger relatives as possible to survive and thrive. That is, while there might have been selection for genes (as yet unidentified) that help humans live past the age of fifty, there was also selection for genes that repair and maintain our bodies when we are physically active. As a result, many of the mechanisms that slow aging and extend life are turned on by physical activity, especially as we get older. Human health and longevity are thus extended both by and for physical activity.

The oxygen we breathe generates energy in cells but leaves behind unstable oxygen molecules with free, unpaired electrons. These reactive oxygen species (charmingly also called free radicals) steal electrons indiscriminately from other molecules, thereby “oxidizing” them. That theft sets off a slow chain reaction by creating other unstable, electron-hungry molecules obliged to steal electrons from yet more molecules. Oxidation burns things gradually and steadily. Just as oxidation causes metal to rust and apple flesh to brown, it damages cells throughout the body by zapping DNA, scarring the walls of arteries, inactivating enzymes, and mangling proteins.

Because mitochondria have their own DNA, they also play a role in regulating cell function, and they produce proteins that help protect against diseases like diabetes and cancer.29 Mitochondria, however, burn oxygen, creating reactive oxygen species that, unchecked, cause self-inflicted damage. When mitochondria cease to function properly or dwindle in number, they cause senescence and illness.

Over time, tiny molecules glue themselves to the DNA in cells. These so-called epigenetic (on top of the genome) modifications can affect which genes are expressed in particular cells.31 Because environmental factors like diet, stress, and exercise partly influence epigenetic modifications, the older we are, the more of them we accumulate.32 Most epigenetic modifications are harmless, but the more you have for a given age, the higher your risk of dying.

By convention, someone has metabolic syndrome if they have most of the following characteristics: high levels of blood sugar, high levels of cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a large waist.
==========
Exercised (Lieberman, Daniel)

Because too much sugar is toxic to many cells, excess sugar stimulates your pancreas to release the hormone insulin, whose basic function is to cause the body to store energy. Among its many actions, insulin directs special molecules on the surfaces of fat and muscle cells to transport sugar from the bloodstream into those cells to be stored or burned. Type 2 diabetes arises when the effects of metabolic syndrome prevent insulin receptors on these cells from binding with insulin (a phenomenon termed resistance). A vicious cycle ensues. When insulin binding doesn’t happen, the glucose transporters don’t take up sugar from the bloodstream. Then, as blood sugar levels rise, the brain desperately commands the pancreas to produce yet more insulin, but with diminishing effect, causing blood sugar levels to stay dangerously high. Symptoms include frequent thirst and peeing, nausea, tingly skin, and swollen feet. Eventually, the overworked pancreas fails, requiring injections of insulin to avoid death.
==========

exercise can reverse insulin resistance by restoring blocked insulin receptors and causing muscle cells to produce more of the transporter molecules that shuttle sugar out of the bloodstream.

Plaques, however, don’t simply accumulate in arteries like crud settling in a pipe. Instead, they are dynamic, changing, growing, shifting, and sometimes breaking. They develop when white blood cells in arteries trigger inflammation by reacting to damage usually caused by a combination of high blood pressure and so-called bad cholesterol that irritates the walls of the artery. In an effort to repair the damage, white blood cells produce a foamy mixture that incorporates cholesterol and other stuff and then hardens.

The first is low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often termed bad cholesterol. Your liver produces these balloon-like molecules to transport fats and cholesterol throughout your bloodstream, but some LDLs have a harmful tendency to burrow into the walls of arteries, especially when blood pressure is high. These intrusions cause an inflammatory reaction that generates plaques. The second type of cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein (HDL), sometimes called good cholesterol, because these molecules scavenge and return LDLs back to the liver. The third type are triglycerides, fat molecules that are floating freely in the bloodstream and a signpost for metabolic syndrome. To make a long story short, diets rich in sugar and saturated fats contribute to cardiovascular disease because they promote high levels of plaque-forming LDLs. Conversely, physical activity helps prevent cardiovascular disease by lowering triglycerides, raising HDL levels, and to a lesser degree lowering LDL.

Women who exercise moderately produce more than enough hormones to reproduce, but the bodies of sedentary women naturally shunt more energy toward reproduction, leading to 25 percent higher levels of estrogen.95 Because reproductive hormones like estrogen induce cell division in breast tissue, inactivity increases the risk of breast cancer, while exercise has the opposite effect.

All mammalian species spend some fraction of their sleep time in REM, and that fraction steadily decreases as they get older.47 In humans, infants spend half of their sleeping time in REM, adults spend only 10–20 percent of sleep in REM, and the elderly spend even less. This cross-species trend is consistent with the fact that infants’ brains are so much more plastic (as we will see in chapter 9), and thus the competition for territory is even more critical. As an animal gets older, cortical takeovers become less possible. The falloff in plasticity parallels the falloff of time spent in REM sleep.

The SCN is the master clock that controls dozens of other clocks throughout your body. Over the course of the day, your core temperature, blood pressure, cognition, hormonal flow, alertness, energy, digestion, hunger, metabolism, creativity, sociability, and athleticism, and your ability to heal, memorize, and sleep, among many other functions, fluctuate according to and are governed by the commands of your inner clocks.

Caffeine isn’t responsible for the laxative effect, though. If it were, chocolate and soda would also bring on the urge. What does the trick is coffee’s unique acidic quality and compounds that cause the stomach to speed up the digestive process and increase the body’s production of two GI tract hormones, gastrin and cholecystokinin.

Caffeine is the most abused substance on the planet, and, despite our being conditioned to associate morning grog with a morning joe, coffee does not combat sleep inertia. Although caffeine is a stimulant, and it will make you jittery, it does not actually make you more awake. In fact, it only makes you less sleepy. Adenosine is a substance in our brains that makes us feel sleepy. Caffeine is an adenosine receptor inhibitor, effectively putting the brakes on sleepiness. This mechanism can be a wonderful thing at 2:00 p.m. Adenosine, a by-product of cellular metabolism, gradually builds up over the course of the day. But upon waking, thanks to your inner clock, you don’t have adenosine in your system. Drinking coffee in the morning is like throwing water on an already extinguished fire. Coffee does give you a hit of adrenaline, which is why people equate it with feeling energized. The problem is, caffeine tolerance builds up over time, and you need to increase the amount of intake to get the effect, just as with any other addicting drug.

Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action (Simon Sinek)

Remember, people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it. If a company does not have a clear sense of WHY then it is impossible for the outside world to perceive anything more than WHAT the company does.

Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action (Simon Sinek)

Leading is not the same as being the leader. Being the leader means you hold the highest rank, either by earning it, good fortune or navigating internal politics. Leading, however, means that others willingly follow you—not because they have to, not because they are paid to, but because they want to.

Energy motivates but charisma inspires. Energy is easy to see, easy to measure and easy to copy Charisma is hard to define, nearly impossible to measure and too elusive to copy. All great leaders have charisma because all great leaders have clarity of WHY; and an undying belief in a purpose or cause bigger than themselves.

Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task wil swel in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time al otted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a mountain out of a molehil . If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.

We put so much pressure on these guys and overwhelmed them. A good leader would come back and say [something like one of the following], ‘I lost it, I didn’t control it. I didn’t do a good job. I didn’t see what was happening. I got too absorbed in this little tiny tactical situation that was right in front of me.’ Either they’d make those criticisms about themselves, or they’d ask, ‘What did I do wrong?’ And when you told them, they’d nod their head, pull out their notebook, and take notes. That right there, that’s a guy who’s going to make it, who’s going to get it right.

Game Changers: What Leaders, Innovators and Mavericks Do to Win at Life (Asprey, Dave)

Sleep experts have long known about the importance of avoiding the “supine” sleep position—lying flat on your back. In this position, gravity contributes to the collapse of the airway. Almost everyone, whether they have a sleep disorder or not, is more susceptible to airway collapse and deeper oxygen desaturation when they sleep on their backs. People who don’t have sleep apnea will simply snore more when they’re on their backs, while those with sleep apnea are more likely to stop breathing in this position.
==========
Game Changers: What Leaders, Innovators and Mavericks Do to Win at Life (Asprey, Dave)

How do you know if you could have sleep apnea? One of the most common symptoms is snoring. Snoring is a sign that your airway is collapsing somewhat during sleep and your airflow is being limited when you try to inhale. If you snore really loudly, you have an increased risk for sleep apnea. If your spouse or other bed partner notices that you appear to stop breathing during sleep, that’s an even bigger risk factor. But most important, if you are sleepy during the daytime, meaning that you’re not just tired but actually fall asleep when you don’t intend to, such as when you’re watching TV or reading a boring book, you’re at even greater risk.

Leadership is a quality rather than a job. We are all leaders and followers at different points in our lives. Many aspects of this book should be useful to those looking to grow as leaders as well as managers, and great managers should cultivate leadership not just in themselves but also within their teams. This is an important distinction because while the role of a manager can be given to someone (or taken away), leadership is not something that can be bestowed. It must be earned. People must want to follow you. You can be someone’s manager, but if that person does not trust or respect you, you will have limited ability to influence him.

It is not advisable to change career paths in your late 30s or 40s if you don’t have a mentor who can guide you. The truth is, at that point, you do not have much time to dilly-dally. Of course, you also need mentors in your 20s, but there’s still time to remediate mistakes at that phase. However, for someone in their late 30s up to their 50s, it is riskier to take career risks at that point. This is why it is crucial to have a mentor to guide you in the field you want to go into before you leap.

The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.
==========
Atomic Habits (Clear, James)

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.
==========
Atomic Habits (Clear, James)

By now, you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
==========
Atomic Habits (Clear, James)

One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit.

You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain.

It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.

Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong – yes, even that you know is wrong – isn’t it better to begin by saying, “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”

I read a fable about the sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said, “I’ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.” So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him. Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force.

The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says “No” and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism glandular, nervous, muscular gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to the contrary, a person says “Yes,” none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward – moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.

Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique – be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it – and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.

The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior: 1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person. 2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do. 3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants. 4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. 5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.
